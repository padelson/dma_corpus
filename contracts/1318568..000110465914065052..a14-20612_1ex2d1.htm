following, the Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold

Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of formation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified in accordance with

 



       
 

 



 

applicable Law and the certificate of formation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or
removal.

 



 

ARTICLE III.

 



 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Certain Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common
Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company, or by Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their wholly owned Subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of All Other Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ or Dissenting Shares as provided in _Section 3.5_ ) shall be
converted into the right to receive $36.50 in cash (the " **Merger
Consideration** "), without interest. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Total Common Merger Consideration** " shall mean the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding (other than
shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_ or Dissenting Shares as provided in _Section 3.5_ ) immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration. Each share of Company
Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in the first sentence of this _Section 3.1(c)_
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of certificates (the " **Certificates** ") or book-entry shares ("
**Book-Entry Shares** ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 3.4_ ) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.2(c)_ , the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, for
each such share of Company Common Stock held by them. Pursuant to _Section
3.2(c)(ii)_ , holders of Book-Entry Shares shall have the right to receive, in
accordance with _Section 3.2_ , the Merger Consideration without any
requirement to deliver the Certificates or a letter of transmittal.

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, no
par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time

 



      
 

 



 

shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) _Equitable Adjustment_. If, at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable into or exercisable such capital stock of the Company, shall
occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, merger or other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent item shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change to provide the holders
of shares of capital stock of the Company the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_
that nothing in this _Section 3.1(e)_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement or to prevent Parent or Merger Sub from exercising any
remedies that may be available to them as a result of any such change.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company, the identity
and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " **Paying Agent** "), it being agreed by the parties that
American Stock Transfer and Trust is acceptable, for the payment of the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(c)_. At or prior to the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than holders of shares to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ , the Dissenting Shares as provided in _Section 3.5_ or
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ ) cash constituting an amount equal to
the Total Common Merger Consideration (such Total Common Merger Consideration
as deposited with the Paying Agent, the " **Exchange Fund** "). In the event
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 3.1(c)_ , Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Nothing contained in
this _Section 3.2_ and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration. Parent
shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and (ii) applied promptly to making
the payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. Except as provided in _Section
3.2(d)_ or _Section 3.2(f)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second (2nd ) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the
form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instruction shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to the Merger Closing.

 



 

(c) Surrender Procedures.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Upon the later of the Effective Time and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ ,
and the Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied
by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Except with respect to Dissenting
Shares, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2(c)_ , each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon
the Effective Time (or at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall
be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Book-Entry Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("
**DTC** ") to ensure that (A) if the Merger Closing occurs at or prior to 2:00
p.m., New York City time on the Merger Closing Date, the Paying Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Merger Closing Date an amount in cash
in immediately available funds equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " **DTC
Payment** "), and (B) if the Merger Closing occurs after 2:00 p.m., New York
City time on the Merger Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominee on the first (1st) Business Day after the Merger Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by the applicable former shareholders of the Company one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such
Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with
respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_ , and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America. After payment of the Merger
Consideration, any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.3 _Equity Awards._

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock Units; Performance Share Awards_.

 



 

(i) _Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option granted
prior to the date hereof and that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall automatically
terminate and be canceled without any action on the part of any holder of such
Company Option in consideration for the right at the Effective Time to receive
in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the Option
Cash Payment. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take the actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3(a)(i)_. For
purposes of this Agreement, " **Option Cash Payment** " means, with respect to
any Company Option, a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the cancellation of such Company Option and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price payable
per share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Company Option, without
interest and less any required withholding Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt,
if the exercise price per share of any Company Option, whether vested or
unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, then by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof,
the Company Option will automatically terminate and be canceled without
payment of any consideration to the holder.

 



 

(ii) _Company Performance Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each equity-based
award that is subject to performance-based conditions (each a " **Company
Performance Share Award** ") pursuant to any Company Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
automatically terminate and be canceled without any action on the part of any
holder of any such Company Performance Share Award in consideration for the
right at the Effective Time to receive in full satisfaction of the rights of
such holder with respect thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, the Performance Share Award Payment. The "
**Performance Share Award Payment** " means, with respect to any Company
Performance Share Award, a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Performance Share Award (assuming achievement of the applicable performance-
based conditions at the maximum level) and (B) the Merger Consideration,
without interest and less any required withholding Taxes.

 



 

(iii) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Stock Unit granted on or prior to the date hereof that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall automatically terminate and be canceled and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such cancellation and in
full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time

 



      
 

 



 

(except as otherwise provided in _Section 3.3(a)(iv)_ ), a cash payment equal
to the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any required
withholding Taxes (the " **Restricted Award Payment** ").

 



 

(iv) _Manner of Making Payment_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation
sufficient cash funds to make all Option Cash Payments, all Restricted Award
Payments and all Performance Share Award Payments, in each case, subject to
and as required pursuant to this _Section 3.3(a)_ and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make such payments to all holders of Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Share Awards, as
applicable, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in
any event, within five (5) Business Days thereafter or, if later, on the
earlier of any special payroll date elected by the Surviving Corporation and
the first payroll date of the Surviving Corporation that occurs after the
Merger Closing Date; provided that to the extent payment within such time or
on such date would trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,
such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not
trigger such tax or penalty.

 



 

(v) _New Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding award of New
Options shall be assumed by Parent (the " **Assumed Options** ") and shall be
converted into a new award covering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock) (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered
by the New Option award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Equity Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
of such New Option by (y) the Equity Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed Option shall
otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
(including the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth
in the applicable Company Plan and the applicable stock option agreement or
other agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that Parent shall have any and all amendment and administrative
authority with respect to such Assumed Option (subject, in the case of any
amendment, to any required consent of the affected holder of such Assumed
Option).

 



 

(b) _Certain Actions_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) effectuate the provisions of _Section
3.3(a),_ (ii) terminate all of the Company Plans other than the Company
Plan(s) pursuant to which a New Option has been granted, as of the Effective
Time, and (iii) ensure that any options, other equity-based awards or other
rights granted or issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the date hereof (or promised to be granted pursuant to Contracts or offer
letters entered into prior to the date hereof by which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is party or bound) that may entitle any Person to own any
capital stock of or other equity interests in Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries prior of the date hereof or to receive any
payment or other consideration in respect of the foregoing shall be canceled
immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment therefor (except
for the cash payments expressly contemplated by this _Section 3.3_ ); it being
understood that the intention of the parties is that, immediately

 



      
 

 



 

following the Effective Time, except with respect to holders of New Options,
no holder of any Company Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company
Performance Share Award or any participant in any Company Plan or other
employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock, stock appreciation
rights or other equity interest) of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to such Company
Plan, other arrangement or otherwise.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if such Person owns at
least 0.1% of the authorized capital stock of the Company and if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
customary and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder, who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of
such shares (" **Dissenting Shares** ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Sections 10.351 through 10.368 of the TBOC,
as applicable, shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder of Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the TBOC (and, at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the TBOC), unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the TBOC. If any such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective
Time into and become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall comply, and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall comply, with the information delivery and other requirements under
Sections 10.355 and 10.358 of the TBOC. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the TBOC and received by the Company relating to demands
for appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the TBOC. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Common Stock,
or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demands. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)_ to pay

 



      
 

 



 

for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been
perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand; provided that Parent shall
remain liable to pay the Merger Consideration with respect to such shares upon
withdrawal of the demand for, or loss of the right to, appraisal for such
shares. Each shareholder who, pursuant to Sections 10.351 through 10.368 of
the TBOC, as applicable, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of any
Dissenting Shares will receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation
(but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to such applicable section).

 



 

Section 3.6 _Withholdings_. Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any payment of Merger Consideration, any Option Cash Payment, any Performance
Share Award Payment and any Restricted Award Payment, as applicable, and any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company
Common Stock, Company Options, Company Performance Share Awards or Company
Restricted Stock Units such amounts as Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer following the Effective Time,
they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger
Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(c)_ , for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates.

 



 

ARTICLE IV.

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except to the extent as (i) disclosed in any form, report, schedule, statement
or other document (including all amendments thereto) filed with, or furnished
to, the SEC by the Company, since October 1, 2012 and publicly available prior
to the date hereof (but excluding any forward-looking disclosures set forth in
any risk factor section, any disclosure in any section relating to forward-
looking statements, any other disclosures included in any such form, report,
schedule, statement or other document to the extent they are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) ( _provided_ that in no event shall any disclosure
in any such form, report, schedule, statement or other document qualify or
limit the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Sections
4.2(a)_ , _4.3_ or _4.26_ ) or (ii) disclosed in the corresponding section of
the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood that any information set
forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to apply to and qualify the representation and warranty set forth in
this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and, whether or not an
explicit reference or cross-reference is made, each other representation and

 



      
 

 



 

warranty set forth in this _Article IV_ for which it is reasonably apparent on
its face that such information is relevant to such other representation and
warranty), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized
or formed, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing,
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation and has the

business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business,
and (to the extent applicable) is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing
would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation of the Company, as amended to date (the " **Charter** "), and
Seventh Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, as amended to date (the "
**Bylaws** "), in each case, as most recently filed with the Company SEC

of Company Common Stock, 345,793 shares subject to outstanding Company
Restricted Stock Units, and 192,500 shares subject to Company Performance

options, warrants or other rights to acquire any such stock or securities were
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. As of September 5, 2014, no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote (or
convertible into securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which

under _Section 6.1_ , there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements,
commitments or Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or

circumstances with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their

grounds for any suspension, revocation, termination, amendment, non-renewal,
adverse modification, cancellation or withdrawal of any material Company
Permit other than to the extent resulting from, directly or indirectly, (a)

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii)
all contributions, premiums and other payments required to be made with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due

any Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or other claims (except
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) against or involving any Company
Benefit Plan or asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any

the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than
liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which
premiums have been paid when due) and other than liabilities that would not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that,

single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each,
together with the Company, an " **ERISA Affiliate** "), is now contributing to
or has any liability to, or has at any time within the past six (6) years (and
in the case of any such other Person, only during the period within the past
six (6) years that such other Person was an ERISA Affiliate) contributed to or
had any liability to (i) a "pension plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA; (ii) a
Multiemployer Plan; or (iii) a single employer pension plan (within the

the Code or any similar provision of non-U.S. law, and the trust (if any)
forming a part thereof, has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the IRS as to its qualification under the Code and to the effect
that each such trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code
or has satisfied the applicable requirements for qualification outside the
United States, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred
since the date of such determination or opinion letter that would constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect on such
qualification or tax-exempt status.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan provides post-termination welfare benefits, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide

employment occurs; (iii) applicable workers compensation laws; or (iv)

plans or any other Company Benefit Plan.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
upon occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i) constitute an
event under any Company Benefit Plan or any trust or loan related to any
Company Benefit Plans that will or may result in any payment, acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase the amount or
value of, or any payment or benefits or obligation to fund benefits with
respect to any Person or (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any
restrictions or limitations on the right of the Company to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or
related trust.

 



 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
indemnify, hold harmless or gross-up any individual with respect to any Tax,
penalty or interest under Section 280G or 409A of the Code.

 



 

(h) Except as would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, all Foreign Benefit Plans (i) have been
maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are
intended to qualify for specific tax treatment, meet all the requirements for
such treatment and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-
reserved, are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon
reasonable actuarial assumptions.

to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions

delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger and the Financing, have been duly and validly authorized by all

the Secretary of State). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization,

or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound or affected or (iii) result in any
breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien (other than, in the case of the Financing, any Lien
required or permitted thereunder) on any of the properties or assets of Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit
agreement, or any other Contract or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any
property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such violation, breach, default, right,
termination, amendment, acceleration, or cancellation that would not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Financing, or
performance of their obligations hereunder will require any consent, approval,
authorization, waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

consents, registrations, declarations, notices or filings, assuming the
accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.5,_ are set forth in _Section 5.3(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, (v)
any filings required under the rules of NYSE, and (vi) such other consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, filings or notifications, the failure of
which to have, make or obtain, as applicable, would not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against
either Parent or Merger Sub as would constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.5 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its

to enter into any Contract, pursuant to which: (a) any shareholder of the
Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or
nature than the Merger Consideration, (b) any shareholder of the Company (i)
agrees to vote to approve this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote
against, or not to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in, any

Section 5.6 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be

incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first provided to the Company, in each case, if applicable, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No representation or
warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied
by the Company or any of its Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Financing_. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct
and complete copies of the fully executed debt commitment letter and Fee
Letter from Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. (collectively, the " **Lenders** "), dated as of the date hereof
(including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto as of the
date of this Agreement and together with the related Fee Letter, collectively,
the " **Financing Commitments** "), pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, the Lenders have committed to lend the amounts
set forth therein to Parent and designated Affiliates for the purpose of
refinancing Parents existing senior secured credit facility (to the extent
necessary) and funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
**Financing** "); provided, however, that solely in the case of the Fee
Letter, accurate and complete copies have been delivered to the Company with
only the portions thereof addressing fees payable to the Financing Sources,
pricing caps, securities demand, economic flex terms and other economic terms
redacted.

 



 

(b) All of the Financing Commitments, in the forms provided to the Company by
Parent (except to the extent amended or replaced after the date hereof in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), and any definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing (which definitive agreements, whether entered
into before or after the date of this Agreement (but if entered into after the
date hereof, only to the extent entered into in compliance with the first
sentence of _Section 6.11(d)_ or _Section 6.11(b)(i)_ ), are referred to
collectively in this Agreement as the " **Financing Agreements** ") are, or in
the case of Financing Agreements entered into after the date of this Agreement
will be, in full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations
of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against Parent and the other parties thereto in accordance with
their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be (i) limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws of general application relating to or affecting creditors
rights generally and (ii) subject to general equitable principles (whether
considered in

 



       
 

 



 

a proceeding in equity or at law). As of the date of this Agreement, no
Financing Commitment has been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded,
amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and no such withdrawal,
termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is
contemplated.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor, to
the knowledge of Parent, any other counterparty thereto is in breach of any of
its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, any
of the Financing Commitments and (ii) to Parents Knowledge, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ , _Section
7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_ , no event has occurred or circumstance exists
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably
be expected to (A) constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub, or to the Knowledge of Parent, any counterparty thereto,
under any of the Financing Commitments, (B) constitute or result in a failure
to satisfy a condition precedent set forth in any of the Financing
Commitments, (C) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set
forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material respect or (D)
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing being unavailable. As of the
date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has received any notice
or other communication from any party to any of the Financing Commitments with
respect to (i) any breach or default on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any
other party to any of the Financing Commitments or (ii) any intention of such
party to terminate any of the Financing Commitments or to not provide all or
any portion of the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub (both before and after
giving effect to any "market flex" provisions contained in the Financing
Commitments) (x) have no reason to believe that, assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ , _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section
7.2(c)_ , they will not be able to satisfy on a timely basis each condition
relating to the closing or funding of the Financing; and (y) know of no fact,
occurrence, circumstance or condition that, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ , _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section
7.2(c)_ , would reasonably be expected to (1) cause any of the Financing
Commitments to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded
or to be or become ineffective or (2) otherwise cause the full amount (or any
portion) of the funds contemplated to be available under the Financing
Commitments to not be available to Parent and Merger Sub on a timely basis
(and in any event as of the Merger Closing). Parent and/or Merger Sub have
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by
the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_
, _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_ , the aggregate proceeds from the
Financing, together with any available cash on hand of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, if any, constitute all of the financing required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are
sufficient in amount to provide Parent and Merger Sub with the funds necessary
for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and to satisfy their respective obligations under this Agreement, including
for Parent and Merger Sub to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the
aggregate Option Cash Payments, the aggregate Restricted Award Payments, the
aggregate Performance Share Award Payments, and the aggregate amount of any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments and the payment of all fees, costs and expenses to be
paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses relating to the Financing (such amounts, collectively, the "
**Required Payment Amount** ").

 



 

(e) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the obligation
of any party to any of the Financing Commitments to fund the full amount of
the Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating to the
availability of any "market flex" provisions, other than as expressly set
forth in unredacted portions of the Financing Commitments and the Fee Letter
as in effect and provided to the Company on the date hereof (the " **Disclosed
Conditions** "). Other than the Disclosed Conditions, no Financing Source or
other Person has any right to impose, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Subsidiary obligor have any obligation to accept, any condition
precedent to any funding of the Financing nor any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Financing Commitments (nor any term or condition
which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under
the Financing Commitments). There are no side letters and (except for the
Financing Commitments and the Fee Letter) there are no agreements, contracts,
arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, with any Lender or
Financing Source relating to the Financing or the Financing Commitments that
affect the conditionality or availability of the full amount of the Financing,
except for any customary fee and engagement letters in respect of the
Financing.

 



 

(f) Except with respect to the Persons set forth in _Section 5.7(f)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives has entered into any contract,
agreement or understanding (i) that conditioned the awarding to any agent,
broker, investment banker or financial advisor of any financial advisory role
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby on such person
agreeing to advise any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives on an exclusive basis in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank or investment
bank or other potential provider of financing from providing or seeking to
provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
agrees that a breach of the representation and warranties set forth in this
_Section 5.7_ shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to the
Companys obligations under this Agreement, if (notwithstanding such breach)
Parent and Merger Sub are willing and able to (and actually do) consummate the
Merger on the Merger Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this Agreement,
the authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, no par value per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby,
and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and
prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its

 



      
 

 



 

formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing).

 



 

Section 5.9 _Gaming Approvals and Licensing Matters_. None of Parent, Merger
Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective officers,
directors or Affiliates, any existing beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or
more of the voting stock of Parent, or any lender under the Financing
Commitments, in each case who or which will be required to be licensed or
found suitable under applicable Gaming Laws in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, has ever been denied a gaming license, approval, or related finding of
suitability by any Gaming Authority, or had any gaming license or approval
revoked or suspended. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, there
are no facts or circumstances with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates insofar as such Affiliate-owned interest would be
attributable to Parent or Merger Sub under any applicable Gaming Law, that
would prevent or materially delay receipt of any Gaming Approvals.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.2(a)_ , _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_ , each of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any
Alternative Financing and the payment of the Required Payment Amount, be
Solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " **Solvent** " means that, as of any date of
determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the sum of the debt
(including contingent liabilities) of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, does not exceed the present fair saleable value of the present
assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (b) the capital
of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not unreasonably
small in relation to the business of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; and (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not
have debts including current obligations beyond their ability to pay or
refinance such debts as they mature in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Ownership of Company Securities_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries holds any capital stock, voting securities or equity interests of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or holds any securities or rights
convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for any such shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests, or any rights, warrants, options, calls, commitments or any other
agreements of any character to purchase or acquire any such shares of capital
stock, voting securities or equity interests or any securities or rights
convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for, any such shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, or at any time during the last
three (3) years has been, an "affiliated shareholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 21.602 of the TBOC.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Management Agreements_. As of the date hereof, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub nor any Representative of Parent or Merger Sub has (a) entered
into any employment agreement with any of the Companys directors, officers or
employees, (b) offered employment to any of the Companys directors, officers
or employees, (c) had negotiations with any of the Companys directors,
officers or employees regarding employment after the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Closing or (d) sold, or offered to sell, any direct or indirect equity
interest in the Company to any of the Companys directors, officers or
employees.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Brokers_. Other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, whose fees shall be borne solely by Parent, no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Merger and any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 5.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _Article V_ , none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates nor any other
Person on behalf of any of them makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses or
with respect to any other information provided, or made available, to the
Company or any of its Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the accuracy or completeness
thereof. Except with respect to the representations and warranties of the
Company expressly set forth in _Article IV_ or otherwise in this Agreement,
there is and has been no reliance by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives on any express or
implied representation or warranty of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Proxy Statement_. Within thirty (30) days
following the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed
with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement relating to the
Shareholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " **Proxy Statement** "). Except as expressly contemplated by _Section
6.5_ , the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation with
respect to the Merger. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request
from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. Each of the parties hereto shall use
their reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that the Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response
(which comments shall be provided promptly and be reasonably considered).

 



 

(b) _Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Proxy Statement_. Parent shall
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may
be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement,
including such information that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement,
and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon request of the Company, confirm and/or
supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Shareholders Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(c) _Mailing of Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company shall,
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days
following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date), (x) establish a record date for
and give notice of a meeting of its shareholders, for the purpose of voting
upon the approval of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " **Shareholders  Meeting**") and (y) mail to the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the Shareholders
Meeting a Proxy Statement (such date, the " **Proxy Date** "). The Company
shall duly call, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company, in its reasonable judgment and following consultation with Parent,
shall determine the length of any period for the solicitation of proxies from
its shareholders and, furthermore, that the Company may postpone, recess or
adjourn the Shareholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for
the absence of a quorum, (iii) to solicit additional proxies

 



      
 

 



 

for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval or (iv) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary or
advisable under applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Companys shareholders
prior to the Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 6.2(c)_ , in no event shall the Shareholders Meeting take
place after January 15, 2015 without Parents express written consent. Once
the Company has established a record date for the Shareholders Meeting, the
Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date
for the Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent,
unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Bylaws. Unless the Company
Board shall have effected a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with
the Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws
and all rules of NASDAQ.

 



 

(d) _Amendments to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the
Companys or Parents Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors,
is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, such party shall promptly inform the others. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall (and shall cause each of their applicable Affiliates and
Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, as promptly as practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees to use its respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) defend against
any Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals, orders, waivers,
finding of suitability and authorizations of, actions or nonactions by, any
Governmental Authority (including Gaming Authorities) or any third party
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, and make all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with, and notices to, any Governmental Authorities
(including pursuant to the HSR Act any other applicable Antitrust Law
necessary to start any applicable waiting period and including under Gaming
Laws) and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
from, or to avoid a suit, action, proceeding or investigation by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger; _provided_ , that, in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty
or other consideration to obtain any consent, approval, order, waiver or
authorization in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

 



       
 

 



 

Agreement, including the Merger, under any Contract other than _de minimis_
amounts or amounts that are advanced or reimbursed substantially simultaneous
by Parent and (iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be performed or
consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall the
Company (A) be required to agree to take or enter into any action which is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (B) agree to any obligation
or concession or other action relating to the Antitrust Approval or the
Required Gaming Approvals without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any failure by
the Company to agree to any such obligation or concession by reason of
Parents withholding its written consent from the Company to do so shall not
constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees (i) promptly after the
date hereof, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date
hereof, to file all Notification and Report Forms required under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to file all other
notifications required under any other Antitrust Law or any Gaming Law with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, (including all required initial applications and documents in
respect of officers and directors and Affiliates in connection with obtaining
the Gaming Approvals (and where appropriate indications of further information
to come by supplementary filing)) as soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within thirty (30) days following the date hereof with respect to
the Required Gaming Approvals), (iii) to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material in its
possession that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, any other Antitrust
Law or any Gaming Law, and (iv) to use its reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with,
and subject to, the other provisions of this _Section 6.3_ , to (A) cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law as promptly as reasonably practicable, including,
if possible under applicable Law, by requesting early termination thereof, and
(B) obtain all Gaming Approvals required to permit the parties hereto to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or necessary to
permit Parent to acquire, own and operate the Company. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in
connection with the efforts referred to in _Section 6.3(a)_ to obtain all
requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, any other Antitrust Law or any Gaming Law,
use reasonable best efforts to (1) cooperate in good faith in devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary clearances under any
Antitrust Laws or necessary approvals under any Gaming Laws, (2) avoid any
action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority challenging the
consummation of transactions contemplated hereby, (3) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (4) keep the other party reasonably informed of
any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby (other than to the extent relating to
private or personal information pertaining to any individual which may remain
confidential) and (5) reasonably permit the other party to review any material
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in

 



      
 

 



 

advance of any meeting or conference, where reasonably practicable to do so,
with, any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by such
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences
(telephonic or in person), where reasonably practicable to do so and shall
take the lead in all meetings and communications with, or Proceeding
involving, any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining the
Antitrust Approval and the Required Gaming Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the consent of each party shall be required prior to the taking of any
action (including the failure to take any such action) in connection with
obtaining the Antitrust Approval or any Required Gaming Approvals if such
action (or failure to act) would be reasonably likely to materially delay, or
materially impair the likelihood of obtaining, any such approvals.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section 6.3(b)_ , subject to the last
sentence of _Section 6.3(a)_ , if any objections are asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or
if any Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is instituted (or
threatened in writing to be instituted) by any Governmental Authority or any
other private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or which would otherwise prevent
or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such
further action as may be reasonably necessary, subject to the other provisions
of this _Section 6.3_ (including the last two sentences of _Section 6.3(a)_ ),
using reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking
into account the other conditions to the Merger Closing set forth in Article
VII of this Agreement, and in any event no later than the Termination Date),
which may include to the extent mutually agreed by Parent and the Company
proposing, negotiating, committing to or effecting, by agreement consent
decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise (i) the creation or
termination of relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of
Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) the restructuring or committing to restructure the Surviving
Corporations capital structure or replacing, or issuing non-voting equity
securities to, one or more of the Licensed Parent Persons who is preventing or
materially delaying the receipt of any Gaming Approvals or (iii) any other
actions that would limit the freedom of action of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of its or the Companys or the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries assets, businesses, services, products or product
lines, in each case as reasonably may be required in order to obtain all
Antitrust Approvals or Required Gaming Approvals as promptly as practicable
(including expirations or terminations of waiting periods whether imposed by
Law or agreement, as applicable).

 



 

(d) Subject to applicable Law, each of the parties hereto will furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with the preparation of any required filings or
submissions with any Governmental Authority and will reasonably cooperate in
responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly
informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making
any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying
each other with copies

 



      
 

 



 

of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either party
and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement (other than
confidential business information or private or personal information
pertaining to any individual applicants which may remain confidential).
Neither party shall have any material communication or meeting (telephonic or
in-person) regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with a
Governmental Authority without giving the other party a reasonable opportunity
to attend in person or by phone (unless the Governmental Authority prohibits
such other partys participation or attendance in the communication or
meeting). Parent and Merger Sub agree (i) following receipt of any
communications from any Governmental Authority or Gaming Authority involving
any (x) material issues or (y) requests that are outside the ordinary course
of business in the context of an investigation for a similar transaction, to
promptly advise the general counsel of the Company and to make available
Parents Nevada gaming counsel, and any other relevant state gaming regulatory
counsel and Parents outside accounting firm, to discuss any such issues or
requests, and (ii) to make Parents Nevada gaming counsel, and other relevant
state gaming regulatory counsel and Parents outside accounting firm,
available to the general counsel of the Company for the purpose of discussing
the status of the gaming regulatory approval process. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to (x)
furnish to the Company or its general counsel any confidential personal
information with respect to any individual, or (y) provide for representatives
of the Company to participate in communications or meetings in which a Gaming
Authority is reviewing or discussing such confidential personal information
with respect to any individual.

 



 

(e) If at any time after the date hereof the Company completes its acquisition
of PokerTek, Inc., the Company shall (and cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) obtain all Gaming
Approvals required to operate PokerTek, Inc.; (ii) make any filings or
submissions with appropriate Governmental Authorities to obtain the necessary
clearances to operate PokerTek, Inc. pursuant to applicable Law (including
Gaming Law); (iii) obtain any other licenses that are required for PokerTek,
Inc. to conduct business in any jurisdiction in which it operates; and (iv)
maintain any of the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall
(and cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) furnish to Parent such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as Parent may request in
connection with the preparation of any required filings or submissions with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the acquisition of PokerTek,
Inc. and will reasonably cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Authority, including promptly informing Parent of such inquiry,
consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a
Governmental Authority, and supplying Parent with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between the Company or its
Subsidiaries and any Governmental Authority with respect to the obligations
set forth in this Section (other than confidential business information or
private or personal information pertaining to any individual applicants which
may remain confidential).

 



 

(f) Without prejudice to the provisions of _Section 6.5_ , (i) none of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall take any action to purposely or knowingly
materially delay or impair the Merger Closing, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub
shall not take any action that would cause the representations and warranties
of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the second sentence of _Section 5.9_ to
be untrue.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , the Company will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, provide
to Parent and its authorized Representatives (x) reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice from Parent to their
respective personnel, facilities, properties, books, contracts and records as
Parent may reasonably request and (y) such financial and operating data of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and other information with respect to the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to provide access to, or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide access to, or disclose (a) any information or documents which would
(in the reasonable judgment of the Company) be reasonably likely to (i)
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) violate any applicable Laws (and the
Company shall be permitted to implement customary "clean-room" or other
similar arrangements if the Company reasonably determines, upon advice of
outside counsel, that such arrangements are necessary to comply with
applicable Law), (iii) unreasonably disrupt the businesses and operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) breach any agreement of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Third Party; provided, that each
party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required
consents and take such other reasonable action (such as the entry into a joint
defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client
privilege) to permit such access or disclosure; or (b) if the Company or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any information that is
reasonably pertinent thereto. All information exchanged pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the
parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to comply with, all of their
respective obligations thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 6.5_ , from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company
will not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing non-public
information) the making of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal
or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) other than informing Third Parties of the
existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_ , engage in
negotiations or substantive discussions with, or furnish any nonpublic
information to, any Third Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may ascertain facts from the party making such Acquisition Proposal for the
sole purpose of the Company Board informing itself about the Acquisition
Proposal and the party making it. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, promptly cease and
cause to be terminated all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, promptly request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished and promptly terminate all

 



      
 

 



 

physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person
or its Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time on or following the date hereof and prior to the date that the
Requisite Shareholder Approval is obtained at the Shareholders Meeting, in
the event that the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal, which
Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
result from a material breach of this _Section 6.5_ , the Company and the
Company Board and their Representatives may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 6.5(b)_ , (A) engage in negotiations or substantive discussions
(including, as a part thereof, making counterproposals) with, or (B) furnish
any information and other access to, any Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal and financial advisor, and based on information then available,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that (x) prior to furnishing any
material nonpublic information, the Company receives from such Third Party an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) any such material
nonpublic information so furnished has been previously provided or made
available to Parent or is provided or made available (including through
posting on the Electronic Data Room) to Parent as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within 24 hours thereafter) after being so furnished to such
Third Party. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.5_ by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Board or any
committee thereof) acting in such capacity and at the direction of the Company
shall constitute a breach of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section 6.5(c)_
or _Section 6.5(d)_ , neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or so qualify or modify), the Company Board
Recommendation, or (B) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal,
or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " **Change in
Recommendation** ") or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar
definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with
any Third Party constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
**Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Change in
Recommendation and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_
and this _Section 6.5(c)_ if the Company Board determines (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Company has provided Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons for such action; and provided, further, that
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section 6.5(c)_ unless the Company pays, or causes to be
paid, to Parent

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to
or concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(d) Without limiting _Section 6.5(c)_ , at any time prior to receipt of the
Requisite Shareholder Approval, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement and not arising as a result of a
material breach of this _Section 6.5_ that the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section 6.5(d)_ and, concurrently
with such termination, may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this
_Section 6.5(d)_ unless the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_ , (x) unless the Company shall have provided
to Parent four (4) days prior written notice (the " **6.5 Notice** ") advising
Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and (unless a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreement has been provided to Parent)
specifying, in reasonable detail, the material terms and conditions of any
such Superior Proposal, with all information regarding the identity of the
Third Party making any such Superior Proposal redacted) and, if applicable, a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreement and all material related
documentation, and (y):

 



 

(i) during such four (4) day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have engaged, and shall have caused its Representatives to engage, in good
faith negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this
Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other agreements
contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the
" **Proposed Changed Terms** ") no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the fourth (4th) day of such four (4) day period and shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisor) that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

 



 

(it being understood that any material revision or amendment to the terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new 6.5 Notice (but only on two (2)
additional occasions) and, in such case, all references to four (4) days in
this _Section 6.5(e)_ shall be deemed to be twenty-four (24) hours).

 



 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours
or, in the event the Company Board determines to take any of the actions
contemplated by _Section 6.5(b)_ in accordance with the terms thereof,
substantially concurrent with such

 



      
 

 



 

determination) advise Parent orally and as promptly as possible thereafter in
writing in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal, and
in connection with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions (including the identity of the Third Party making any such
Acquisition Proposal unless such disclosure would violate any Contract by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound) of any such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any
such Acquisition Proposal and any discussions and negotiations concerning the
material terms and conditions thereof.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under applicable Law or in compliance with or
otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Companys shareholders), and
to the extent referred to therein, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys shareholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys shareholders), or (iii) making any disclosure
not of the type provided in clauses (i) or (ii) above to the Companys
shareholders that is reasonably required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board shall not make a Change in Recommendation
or make or authorize any disclosure which would reasonably be expected to have
the same effect as a Change in Recommendation, except in each case in
accordance with _Section 6.5(c)_.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any bona fide proposal or offer (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) from a Third Party
relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose revenues, income, EBITDA or assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated revenues, income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in the case of revenue, income and EBITDA, measured over the
previous twelve (12) months, and in the case of assets, based on fair market
value, as determined in good faith by the Company Board); (ii) the acquisition
(whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or
otherwise) by any Person of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on fair market
value, as determined in good faith by the Company Board); (iii) the
acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock; (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of the Company Common Stock or any class of equity
or voting securities of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries whose
revenues, income, EBITDA or assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated revenues,

 



      
 

 



 

income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in the case of
revenue, income and EBITDA, measured over the previous twelve (12) months, and
in the case of assets, based on fair market value, as determined in good faith
by the Company Board)), or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal (with the
references to "twenty-five percent (25%)" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third
Party on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel, and
considering such factors as the Company Board considers in good faith to be
appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
giving effect to all Proposed Changed Terms).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification
(and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto) for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger), now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in
the Charter or Bylaws (or such equivalent organizational or governing
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or Affiliates as in effect on
the date of this Agreement) or in any Contract between such Indemnitee and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case as in effect on the date
hereof) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and advance expenses to, to the fullest extent the Company
would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law, Indemnitees with
respect to (x) all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at
any time at or prior to the Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to the Merger, this
Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby, in either case, to the
fullest extent permitted by (i) the Charter or Bylaws (or such equivalent
organizational or governing documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
Affiliates as in effect on the date of this Agreement), (ii) any
indemnification agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other
applicable Contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnitees or (iii) applicable Law. Parent shall cause the certificate of
formation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer
and employee liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnitees than
those set forth in the Charter and Bylaws and the Companys Subsidiaries
organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions
thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_ , to the fullest
extent the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will pay in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount even if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
6.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the Companys option, the Company shall,
after consultation with Parent, or, if the Company is unable to (or otherwise
fails), the Surviving Corporation shall obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancelable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies
and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the " **D andO Insurance**"), in each case for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as in effect as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to
pay an aggregate premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by either the
Company or the Surviving Corporation prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall honor all obligations under such policy and cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term. If
the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of
the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall provide, for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are
insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy
of the Company as of the date hereof or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual

 



      
 

 



 

premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; provided, further,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 6.6(c)_.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are
intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors,
heirs or representatives. To the fullest extent the Company would have been
permitted to do so under applicable Law, Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Charter or Bylaws (or
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries), certificate of formation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation, under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_ and use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that a Person no less financially viable than the Surviving
Corporation (in the event the Effective Time occurs) remains responsible for
the obligations of such party under this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Unless prohibited by applicable
Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon receiving Knowledge of (a) any
notice, complaint, investigation or hearing (or communications indicating that
the same may be contemplated) from any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
any written notice of any Person (other than a Governmental Authority)
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (d) any
material change, effect, development or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a failure of a condition precedent in _Section 7.2_
(in the case of the Company) and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent);

 



       
 

 



 

provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties hereunder and any failure to make such
notification (in and of itself) shall not be taken into account in determining
whether the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ (in the case of the Company)
and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent) have been satisfied or give rise to
any right of termination to any party hereto under _Article VIII_.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release(s) announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, any other press release or other public
announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Company will no longer be
required to consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or
public announcement if the Company Board has effected any Change in
Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so and (ii) the requirements of
this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any disclosure by the Company or Parent
of any information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Continuing Employees_.

 



 

(i) Commencing at the Effective Time and until one (1) year thereafter
(provided that if the Merger Closing occurs on or prior to March 31, 2015,
such period shall end on December 31, 2015), Parent shall provide or shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide to
employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who are located in the
United States (" **Company Employees** ") for so long as they continue
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
during such period (A) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and annual
bonus opportunity at least equal to the applicable Company Employees base
salary or wage rate and annual bonus opportunity in effect as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding annual bonus opportunity for any Key
Employee) and (B) other compensation (excluding equity, equity based and other
similar long term incentive opportunities) and employee benefits (including
vacation policies, retirement benefits, health, welfare and fringe benefits or
similar arrangements) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the
compensation and employee benefits being provided to the applicable Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) Without limiting _Section 6.9(a)(i)_ , Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume (if applicable), honor, and provide all of the
Companys employment, severance, retention and change in control obligations
in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual (solely for
the purposes of determining accrual of vacation and paid time off) under the
compensation and benefit plans, programs agreements and arrangements
maintained by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective
Subsidiary and Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Company Employees
after the Merger Closing (the " **New Plans** "), and determination of level
of benefits, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company (including any predecessor), the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any
predecessor employer) before the Merger Closing, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Merger Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; provided, however, that in no
event shall Company Employees be entitled to service credit for any purpose
under post-retirement welfare plans or to the extent such service credit would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan
in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
replacement; and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee from and after
the Effective Time, (x) Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents
to the extent such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting
periods or actively-at-work requirements were waived or satisfied under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan, and (y) Parent shall recognize, or cause to
be recognized, any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan
year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of
any Company Benefit Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or
"change of control," the Merger Closing shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control" or "change of control."

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide Parent, with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such
communications relate to the transactions contemplated hereby and will provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review such communications prior to
distribution.

 



 

(c) This _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_ ,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason

 



      
 

 



 

of this _Section 6.9_ , is intended to be, or shall constitute or be construed
as an amendment to or modification of the Company Benefit Plans, New Plan or
any other employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates or limit in any way the right of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other employee benefit plans or
arrangements. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall limit the right of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any Company Employee at any time following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) No later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall make available to Parent (i) information relating
to each payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) or
benefit that is conditioned on or accelerated by the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any "disqualified individual"
(as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1 that is reasonably
expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and (ii) each disqualified individuals "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code).

 



 

Section 6.10 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Merger Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date hereof
and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take or agree to take any action
(including entering into agreements with respect to any acquisitions, mergers,
consolidations or business combinations) which would reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Financing_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person
under, any financing that Parent and Merger Sub may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided
pursuant to _Section 6.12_ and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint
and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions, taken as a whole
(including the flex provisions) described in the Financing Commitments,
including executing and delivering all such documents and instruments as may
be reasonably required thereunder and using (and causing their Affiliates to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Financing and the Financing
Commitments, negotiate and enter into Financing Agreements with respect
thereto (and maintain in effect and comply with the terms thereof) on the
terms and conditions

 



      
 

 



 

contained in the Financing Commitments (as such terms may be modified or
adjusted in accordance with the terms of any "flex" provisions set forth in
the Financing Commitments (including as specified in any Fee Letter)) or on
other terms no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or obtain the
Financing than those contained in the Financing Commitments; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall any of the
Financing Agreements, except in accordance with the terms of the Financing
Commitments: (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing provided for in
the Financing Commitment (including by changing the amount of fees or original
issue discount contemplated by the Financing Commitments) in a manner that
would adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger; (B) expand, amend or modify the
conditions or other contingencies to the receipt or funding of the Financing
beyond those expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments in a manner that
would adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing (including by making any such conditions or
other contingencies less likely to be satisfied, it being agreed that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may modify, supplement or
amend the Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof on the same terms) or impose any new or
additional condition or other contingency to the receipt or funding of the
Financing in a manner that would adversely impact in any material respect the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Financing; (C) contain terms
(other than those terms expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments) that
would reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or delay in any material respect
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the date on which
the Financing would be obtained, or (2) make the funding of the Financing less
likely to occur; or (D) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to enforce their rights against the Financing Sources.

 



 

(ii) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy all conditions to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments and Financing Agreements
relating thereto (including by paying any commitment, engagement, or placement
or other fees that become due and payable under or with respect to any of the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements);

 



 

(iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all "market flex"
provisions contemplated by the Financing Commitments and the Financing
Agreements;

 



 

(iv) enforce its rights (including through litigation, to the extent
appropriate) under the Financing Commitments and Financing Agreements in the
event of a breach (or threatened breach) by the Financing Sources under the
Financing Commitments and Financing Agreements relating thereto, including
seeking specific performance of the parties thereunder; and

 



 

(v) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent thereto, cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Financing at or prior to the time the Merger
Closing is required to occur pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of,
any condition, remedy or other provision under any Financing Commitment or any
Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company if such
amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) from that contemplated by the Financing Commitments delivered as of
the date hereof in a manner that would adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in each case, in a manner
that would adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing, (iii) make it less likely that the
Financing would be funded (including by making the conditions to obtaining the
Financing less likely to occur (it being agreed that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may modify, supplement or amend the Financing
Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Financing Commitments as of the
date hereof on the same terms)) or otherwise prevent or delay or impair in any
material respect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or
(v) otherwise contravene the limitations set forth in _Section
6.11(b)(i)(A)-(D)_. Other than in connection with an Alternative Financing,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to the withdrawal, repudiation,
termination or rescission of any Financing Commitment or Financing Agreement
or any provision thereof without the prior written consent of the Company (it
being agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may
modify, supplement or amend the Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Financing Commitments as of the date hereof on the same terms).
Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the Financing Commitment or
Financing Agreement in accordance with this _Section 6.11(c)_ , Parent shall
deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references herein to "Financing
Commitment" and "Financing Agreement" (or defined terms that use such phrases)
shall include such documents as amended, supplemented or modified in
compliance with this _Section 6.11(c)_ and references to "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as amended,
supplemented or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.11_ and the
financing contemplated by the Financing Agreements entered into in compliance
with this _Section 6.11_ (as so amended), as applicable. In addition, Parent
shall not enter into any agreement for investment or other provision of
financing with respect to the Merger on an exclusive basis with a Financing
Source prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after the date hereof.

 



 

(d) In the event that all or any portion of the Financing becomes or would
reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements for any reason or any of the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated,
terminated or rescinded for any reason, (i) Parent shall promptly so notify
the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the
Merger Closing Date), and to negotiate and enter into definitive

 



      
 

 



 

agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or alternative
sources (the " **Alternative Financing** "), on terms not less favorable, in
any material respect, with respect to conditionality and enforceability, when
taken as a whole, than those contained in the Financing Commitments to Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or replace any unavailable
portion of the Financing), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter
(including any associated engagement letter and related fee letter) with
respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively, the " **New Financing
Commitment Letter** "), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company (with customary redactions with respect to the fee letter). In the
event any Alternative Financing is obtained and a New Commitment Letter is
entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.11(d)_ (i) any reference in
this Agreement to "Financing" or the "Financing" shall mean the debt financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments as modified pursuant to clause (ii)
below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Commitments"

becomes aware, (B) of the receipt or delivery of any notice or other
communication, in each case from any Person with respect to (x) any actual or
potential breach of any provisions of the Financing Commitments or Financing

agreements relating to the Financing or (y) any dispute or disagreement
between or among parties to any of the Financing Commitments or Financing
Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount

any reason Parent believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ , as it applies to the Companys

Companys breach(es), if any, of its obligations under this _Section 6.12_ did
not cause the failure of the Financing to be obtained or (ii) Parent does not

all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it on or prior to the Merger Closing Date;

ARTICLE VIII. 


 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

the right to terminate this Agreement or extend the Termination Date pursuant
to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to either party if it has
materially breached or violated any of its covenants, agreements or other
obligations hereunder and such material breach or violation has been a
principal cause of or directly resulted in (1) the failure to satisfy the
conditions to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Article VII_ prior to the Termination Date (as the same
may be extended) or (2) the failure of the Merger Closing to occur by the
Termination Date (as the same may be extended); or

its obligations under _Section 6.3_ with respect to such Restraint; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if the Company
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder;

(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated thereby (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise).

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
but subject to _Section 9.9_, the Companys right to receive payment from
Parent of the Funding Failure Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_
shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company and its
shareholders against Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, assignees or Financing Sources (collectively, the " **Parent
Related Parties** ") for all Damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) (except that (i) to the extent any termination of this Agreement
resulted from, directly or indirectly, an Intentional Breach of this Agreement
by Parent or Merger Sub or such Intentional Breach by Parent or Merger Sub
shall cause the Merger Closing not to occur as provided under _Section 8.2_,
the Company shall be entitled to payment of the Funding Failure Termination
Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_) and to any Damages, to
the extent proven, resulting from or arising out of such Intentional Breach
(as reduced by any Funding Failure Termination Fee paid by Parent, and (ii)
nothing shall

 



      
 

 



 

limit the Companys rights to indemnification and reimbursement in accordance
with _Section 6.12(b)_).

 



 

(c) _Integral Part of Transaction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Company
Termination Fee nor the Funding Failure Termination Fee is a penalty and,
except as set forth in _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, each is liquidated damages, in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company (as applicable)
in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay
the Company Termination Fee or if Parent fails to pay the Funding Failure
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ when due, and, in order to
obtain such payment, any other party hereto commences a suit that results in a
judgment against such party for the Company Termination Fee or the Funding
Failure Termination Fee, as the case may be, such party shall pay to such
other party interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the
Funding Failure Termination Fee, as the case may be, from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the rate of 3.25%
per annum.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Shareholder
Approval; provided, however, that after the Requisite Shareholder Approval has
been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the shareholders of the Company without such further approval of
such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by each of the parties hereto; provided, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, _Section 8.3(c)_,
this _Section 8.4_, _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.9(b)_,
_Section 9.10(c)_, _Section 9.12_ or _Section 9.15_ (in each case, together
with any related definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the
extent a modification or termination would serve to modify the substance or
provisions or such Sections) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that is adverse to the Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of the first sentence of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with
any agreement or condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 6.12(b)_, _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Section 9.13_), all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly provided in Section 3.2(c),
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due.

effective on the date specified in such notice or two (2) Business Days after
the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection or other refusal to accept
or the inability to deliver because of changed address of which no notice was
given shall be deemed to be receipt of the notice as of the date of such
rejection, refusal or inability to deliver.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. (a) The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality
for any purpose whatsoever. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter
relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication with respect to any third party that
any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes and Appendices, and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.

 



 

(e) Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of
comparable successor Laws and the related regulations and published
interpretations thereof; _provided_ , that for purposes of any representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date
or dates, references to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law, as
amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case,
as of such date. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

(f) The words "made available to Parent" or words of similar import refer to
documents (x) posted to the Electronic Data Room on or prior to the date
hereof or (y) delivered in Person or electronically to Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Representatives. The specification of any dollar
amount in any representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ or
_Article V_ is not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, are or are not material for purposes of this Agreement, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or
controversy between or among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. The phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and
terms or phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to September 8,
2014, unless the context requires otherwise. When used in reference to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the term "material" shall be measured against the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall." References
to "$" or "dollars" in this Agreement shall mean United States dollars. Words
describing the singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice
versa, words denoting any gender shall be deemed to include all genders and
words denoting natural Persons shall be deemed to include business entities
and vice versa. Whenever the words "day" or "days" are used in this Agreement,
they are deemed to refer to calendar days unless expressly stated to be
Business Days.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law,
or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable,
(b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; provided that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of
their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary
of Parent or to any other Person of Parents choosing, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its obligations
hereunder; provided, further, that such assignment shall not prevent or
materially delay the Merger Closing. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 9.5_ shall be null
and void.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules, Annexes and Appendices hereto and other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the entire
agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for (a) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the Companys
shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, (b)
from and after the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company Options
to receive the Option Cash Payment, (c) from and after the Effective Time, the
right of the holders of Company Restricted Stock Units to receive Restricted
Award Payments, (d) from and after the Effective Time, the right of the
holders of Company Performance Share Awards, to receive the Performance Share
Award Payments, (e) the provisions of _Section 6.6_ (which shall be
enforceable by the Indemnitees), (h) the provisions of _Section 6.12(b)_
(which shall be enforceable by the 6.12 Indemnitees) and (i) with respect to
the Financing Sources, the provisions of _Section 8.3(c)_, _Section 8.4_,
this _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.9(b)_, _Section 9.10(c)_,
_Section 9.12_ and _Section 9.15_. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit

 



       
 

 



 

of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_
without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. The provisions of this Agreement and any other
document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto, their negotiation,
execution, performance or nonperformance, interpretation, termination,
construction and all matters based upon, arising out of or related to any of
the foregoing (whether in equity, law or statute) shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws, both procedural and
substantive, of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely within such State, without regard to the conflicts of law
principles of such State; provided, however, that the laws of the State of
Texas shall govern to the extent that the provisions of the TBOC are
specifically referenced herein or that it is mandatory that the TBOC apply to
any of the provisions of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and to (i) the rights (including dissenters rights) of
shareholders in connection with, the Merger and (ii) the duties and
obligations of the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 9.9_ ,
including the limitations set forth in _Section 9.9(b)_ , the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled, without
posting a bond or other indemnity, to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the
Marketing Period, if applicable, has ended and all of the conditions set forth
in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Merger
Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Merger Closing by
the date the Merger Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section
2.2_ , (iii) the Financing (including any Alternative Financing that has been
obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, _Section
6.11(d)_ of this Agreement) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Merger
Closing assuming satisfaction by Parent or Merger Sub of the conditions
precedent thereto under their respective control, and (iv) the Company has
confirmed in an irrevocable written notice delivered to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Financing is

 



      
 

 



 

funded, then it would take such actions that are within its control to cause
the Merger Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) in no event shall
the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents
and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger if the Financing has not
been funded or will not be funded at the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only
to the extent expressly permitted by this _Section 9.9_ and the payment of the
Funding Failure Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ ), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance to cause the
Closing to occur in accordance with this _Section 9.9_ and payment of the
Funding Failure Termination Fee, or alternatively, any other monetary damages
or other monetary remedies, whether under this Agreement, the Financing
Commitment Letters or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 9.9(b)_ , each party hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 9.9_. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.9_. The parties hereto further
agree, subject to _Section 9.9(b)_ , that (i) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this _Section 9.9_ , a party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.9_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.9_
shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.9_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VIII_ , nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding
pursuant to this _Section 9.9_ or anything set forth in this _Section 9.9_
restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. (a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state
and federal courts sitting in the County, City and State of New York and
appellate courts therefrom (collectively, the " **Chosen Courts** "), for the
purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract,
tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in the Chosen Courts.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party and nothing in this _Section 9.10_ shall affect the right of any

 



      
 

 



 

party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (ii)
irrevocably consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (iv) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
_Section 9.10_ , (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the City of New
York, New York, whether a state or Federal court, and that the provisions of
_Section 9.12_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim. The
provisions of this _Section 9.10(c)_ shall be enforceable by each Financing
Source, its Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
other electronic transmission, including by e-mail attachment, shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER
SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.13 _Attorneys  Fees_. In any action at law or suit in equity to
enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the
prevailing party in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive
reimbursement for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred in such action or suit.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of
the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to
take such action.

 



 

Section 9.15 _No Recourse Against Related Parties_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or elsewhere, no Financing Source
shall have any liability, personal or otherwise, or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the exploration or negotiation thereof for any breach or damages suffered
(i) as a result of the failure of the Merger or any of the transactions to be
consummated or (ii) as a result of, or under, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or in respect of any
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith).
