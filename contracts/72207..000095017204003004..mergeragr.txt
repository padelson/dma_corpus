AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of
December 15, 2004, by and among Patina Oil and Gas Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), Noble Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent") and Noble Energy Production, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser").   WHEREAS, the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each approved
this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into Purchaser (the
"Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL");   WHEREAS, the respective Boards
of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined that the Merger is
fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective stockholders; and  
WHEREAS for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, (b) this Agreement will constitute a plan of reorganization and
(c) Parent, Purchaser and the Company will each be a party to such
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.1.
The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged
with and into Purchaser. At the Effective Time, the separate existence of the
Company shall cease and Purchaser shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effect as provided
in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, upon the Merger, all the rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all the obligations, duties, debts and liabilities
of the Company and Purchaser shall be the obligations, duties, debts and
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.2. Effective Time.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly
as practicable after the Closing and on the Closing Date, Purchaser and the
Company will cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to
be duly prepared, executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") as provided in the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time when the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or,
subject to the DGCL, such other time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such time is hereinafter referred
to as the "Effective Time."   Section 1.3. Closing. Unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated herein abandoned
pursuant to Section 7.1 and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m., Houston time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to waive the condition) of all
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (except for those conditions that
by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) (the "Closing Date"), at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 1600 Smith Street, Suite
4400, Houston, Texas 77002, unless another time, date and/or place is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto.   Section 1.4. Certificate of
Incorporation; Bylaws. Pursuant to the Merger, (a) the Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
and (b) the Bylaws of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.  
Section 1.5. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation and Certain
Subsidiaries.   (a) The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws.   (b) The officers of Purchaser immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.   Section 1.6. Effect on Capital Stock.  
(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Article I
and Section 2.1, each share of the Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
of Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and except for any
Dissenting Shares), together with the Company Rights attached thereto or
associated therewith, shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable
for the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided
in and subject to the provisions of Section 1.7, either (i) the Per Share
Stock Consideration or (ii) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share
Consideration (the "Per Share Cash Consideration", and together with the Per
Share Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").  For purposes of
this Agreement:   "Aggregate Consideration" shall mean the sum of (x) the
Total Stock Consideration and (y) the Total Cash Amount.   "Deemed Stock
Amount" shall mean the Total Common Stock Amount; provided, however, that
regardless of the actual number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in no event shall the Deemed Stock
Amount exceed the sum of (i) 72,820,413, (ii) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock, if any, issued by the Company after the Cut-off Time
and prior to the date of this Agreement upon the exercise of the Company
Options or Company Warrants (in each case outstanding as of the Cut-off Time
and disclosed in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) in
accordance with the terms of such options and (iii) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock, if any, issued by the Company after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section
5.1(e).   "Exchange Ratio" shall mean the quotient, rounded to the
nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing the Per Share Consideration by
the Final Parent Stock Price.   "Final Parent Stock Price" shall mean the
volume-weighted average of the trading sale prices per share of Parent Common
Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") during the
Valuation Period.   "Per Share Consideration" shall mean the quotient,
rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing the Aggregate
Consideration by the Total Common Stock Amount.   "Per Share Stock
Consideration" shall mean a number of shares (which need not be a whole
number) of Parent Common Stock (together with the number of Parent Rights
associated therewith) equal to the Exchange Ratio.   "Total Cash Amount"
shall mean the product obtained by multiplying (x) $37.00 by (y) 40% of the
Deemed Stock Amount.   "Total Common Stock Amount" shall mean the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   "Total Stock Amount" shall mean the product obtained by
multiplying (x) 0.62521 by (y) 60% of the Deemed Stock Amount.   "Total
Stock Consideration" shall mean the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Total Stock Amount by (y) the Final Parent Stock Price.   "Valuation Period"
shall mean the ten consecutive trading days during which the shares of Parent
Common Stock are traded on the NYSE ending on the third calendar day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, or if such calendar day is not a
trading day, then ending on the trading day immediately preceding such
calendar day.   (b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock, and
associated Company Rights, converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each
a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii)
any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c), and
(iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(e).   (c) If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
changed or proposed to be changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of the occurrence of or record date with respect to any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or similar readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period,
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Cash Consideration and
the Per Share Stock Consideration.   (d) At the Effective Time, all shares
of Company Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; provided, however,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 1.6(d) shall not apply to
shares of Company Common Stock held by or on behalf of the Deferred
Compensation Plan or the New Deferred Compensation Plan, as to which Section
1.6(a) shall apply. All shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall become authorized unissued stock of
Parent.   (e) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.   (f) The calculations required by Section
1.6(a) shall be prepared by Parent promptly after the Closing.   Section
1.7. Election Procedures.   (a) An election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates theretofore
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent
shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Election Form") shall be mailed together with the Proxy Statement or at such
other time as the Company and Parent may agree (the "Mailing Date") to each
holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the
record date for notice of the Company Special Meeting (the "Election Form
Record Date").   (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or
the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation
and instructions), other than any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i)
the number of shares of such holder\'s Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration
("Stock Election Shares"), (ii) the number of shares of such holder\'s
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration ("Cash Election Shares"), or (iii) that such
holder makes no election with respect to such holder\'s Company Common Stock
("No Election Shares"). Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election
Form on or before 5:00 p.m., Houston time, on the 33rd day following the
Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Company and Parent shall
agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than any shares of Company Common
Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed
to be "No Election Shares."   (c) Parent shall make available one or more
Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all
Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock
between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the
Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to
the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as
specified herein.   (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only
if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed
properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or
customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates)
representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election
Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the
Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares and Parent shall cause the Certificates representing Company
Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting
the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who
submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent
election is properly made with respect to any or all of the applicable shares
of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall
be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Purchaser or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form.   (e) Within ten Business Days after the Election Deadline,
unless the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after
the Effective Time as practicable (and in no event more than ten Business
Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
effect the allocation among the holders of Company Common Stock of rights to
receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the
Election Forms as follows:   (i) Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash
Amount. If  the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion
of the  Cash Election Shares in the Merger is greater than the Total Cash
Amount,  then:   (1) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares 
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock 
Consideration,   (2) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the 
Cash Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number 
of shares ("Stock Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount 
that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total 
Cash Amount, and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the 
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and   (3) the Cash
Election Shares that are not Stock  Designated Shares will be converted into
the right to receive the Per  Share Cash Consideration.   (ii) Cash
Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount. If  the aggregate cash amount
that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash  Election Shares in the Merger
is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:   (1) all Cash Election Shares
shall be converted into the  right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration,   (2) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from  among
the No Election Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock  Election
Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of  shares
("Cash Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that  will be
paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash  Amount,
and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right  to receive
the Per Share Cash Consideration, and   (3) the Stock Election Shares and
the No Election shares  that are not Cash Designated Shares shall be
converted into the right to  receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.  
(iii) Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount. If  the aggregate cash
amount that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash  Election Shares in the
Merger is equal to the Total Cash Amount, then  subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
above shall not apply and all Cash Election  Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash  Consideration and all Stock Election
Shares and No Election Shares shall  be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration.   Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of determining the allocations set
forth in this Section 1.7(e), Parent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to require that any shares of Company Common Stock that
constitute Dissenting Shares as of the Election Deadline be treated as Cash
Election Shares, although no such shares shall be subject to any of the pro
rata selection processes contemplated by this Section 1.7(e).   (f) The pro
rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist of such
equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined by Parent and
the Company.   Section 1.8 Stock Options and Warrants. (a) At the
Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each a "Company Option") pursuant to any stock option
plan, program or arrangement of the Company, including, without limitation,
the Company\'s 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan (as amended) and 1996 Stock
Plan for Non-Employee Directors (collectively, the "Company Option Plans"),
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
and shall be converted automatically into options to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Company Option
(hereinafter, "Assumed Option") subject to the terms of the applicable
Company Option Plan and the agreement evidencing the grant thereunder of such
Assumed Option (other than the provisions thereof providing for termination
of such Assumed Option at the Effective Time); provided, however, that (i)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of such
Assumed Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were purchasable under such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and rounded to the nearest
whole share, (ii) the per share exercise price under such Assumed Option
shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under such Company
Option by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding to the nearest whole cent and
(iii) such Assumed Option shall not terminate if the holder ceases to be a
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its affiliates (including Parent and its Subsidiaries), unless the
applicable Company Option was issued after December 8, 2004, in which case
such Assumed Option shall terminate (A) immediately upon the Surviving
Corporation or any of its affiliates (including Parent and its Subsidiaries)
terminating its employment or retention of such holder for "Cause" (as
defined in the applicable Company Option Plan) or (B) otherwise, 60 days
after the holder ceases to be a director, officer, employee or consultant of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates (including Parent and its
Subsidiaries). In the case of any Assumed Option that is an "incentive stock
option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), the exercise price, the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Assumed
Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
be determined in order to comply, to the fullest extent possible, with
Section 424(a) of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare
and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering
all the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Options, and
such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status
of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) as
long as any Assumed Option remains outstanding.   (b) If the Company
Warrant is not exercised prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the
Company Warrant in accordance with its terms at the Effective Time by
executing a supplemental agreement with the holder of the Company Warrant in
accordance with the terms of the Company Warrant.   Section 1.9 Dissenting
Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the holder thereof
shall have properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
as to appraisal rights (each, a "Dissenting Share"), if any, such holder
shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the
appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however,
that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances
permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his
demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or
fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not
entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as
the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of
Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon
cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and if such forfeiture shall occur
following the Election Deadline, each such share of Company Common
Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest
thereon, the Per Share Stock Consideration; provided that Parent shall be
entitled to convert each such share into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration or a combination of the Per Share Cash Consideration and
Per Share Stock Consideration if Parent shall have received an opinion from
Skadden Arps stating that the Merger shall not fail to satisfy the continuity
of interest requirement under Section 368 of the Code as a result thereof.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with
respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares
without the written consent of Parent.   ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with Wachovia Bank, N.A. or another bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange
Agent, sufficient cash and certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock to make pursuant to this Article II all deliveries of cash and Parent
Common Stock as is required by Article I. Parent agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e).
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by Sections 2.1(c) and 2.1(e), the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. Any cash and certificates representing Parent
Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in customary form and subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior
to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6 (after taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by all Certificates then held
by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of
the Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6 and this Article II, including cash payable
in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.1(e) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(c). No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange
Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.1, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).   (c) Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such
Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.1. Following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (b) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such shares of
Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.  
(d) Further Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any payments made pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or
Section 2.1(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.   (e)
Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to have any rights as a holder of any shares of Parent Common Stock.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the average of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock
on the NYSE as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days
immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall occur
and (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6. As promptly
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge that payment
of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock was not separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and
accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.   (f) Termination of Exchange
Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from and after such delivery to
Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.   (g) No
Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (h) Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each
case, without any interest thereon.   (i) Withholding. Each of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under
the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect
to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.   Section 2.2 Stock Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange
Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), without any
interest thereon.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the

hospitalization or other medical, life or other insurance, disability, other
welfare, supplemental unemployment, profit-sharing, pension, or retirement
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, and each other director or employee
compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or by
any trade or business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"),
that together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or to which the
Company or an ERISA Affiliate is party, whether written or oral, for the
benefit of any current or former officer, employee or director of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate (the "Company
Plans").   (b) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company
has heretofore delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of each of
the following documents (including all amendments to such documents),
as applicable:   (i) the Company Plan or a written description of any 
Company Plan not in writing;   (ii) a copy of the most recent annual report
or Internal  Revenue Service Form 5500 Series, including all related reports
required  therewith;   (iii) a copy of the most recent Summary Company
Plan  Description ("SPD"), together with all Summaries of Material

Company Plans, any trust created thereunder and, to the knowledge of the
Company, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction or
has taken or failed to take any action with respect to a Company Plan in
connection with which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate would be reasonably likely to be subject to a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975(a) or (b), 4976 or 4980B of the Code.   (e) All
contributions required to be made by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Company Plan on or prior to the Closing Date have been timely
made or are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated
as of September 30, 2004 contained in the Specified Company SEC Documents.
Since September 30, 2004, there has been no amendment to,
written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in the terms of
employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Plan above the
level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year
ended prior to the date hereof.   (f) Each of the Company Plans has been

the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that would be reasonably
likely to affect such qualified status. No fund established under a Company
Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.   (h) No amounts payable under the Company Plans as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby will fail to be deductible for
federal income Tax purposes by virtue of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the
Code.   (i) No Company Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization
or similar benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any current or
former employee of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
after retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any "employee pension
plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits,
the full direct cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or
beneficiary thereof).   (j) The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other similar termination
payment under any Company Plan, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of, increase the amount of or otherwise enhance any benefit due any
such employee, officer or director under any Company Plan.   (k) To the
knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(c) of the Code) and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred a Tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or
could become a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (l)

Litigation by, on behalf of or against any Company Plan by any participant

Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).   Section 3.10

Company SEC Documents, (i) there is no Litigation pending or, to the

or would be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, and (iii) there is no Litigation that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has pending against other parties, where such Litigation is
intended to enforce or preserve material rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied,
and is in compliance, in all material respects with all Laws and Permits
which affect the respective businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Company Real Property and/or the Company Assets, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries have not been and are not in violation in any
material respect of any such Law or Permit; nor has any notice, charge, claim
or action has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or been
filed, commenced, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries alleging any violation of the
foregoing.   (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all Permits
necessary for the ownership, leasing, operation, occupancy and use of the
Company Real Property, the Company Assets and the conduct of their respective
businesses as currently conducted ("Company Permits"), except where the
failure to hold such Company Permits individually or in the aggregate has not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice that any Company Permit will be terminated
or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business, and the
Company has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination,
modification or nonrenewal, in each case except for any such terminations,
modifications or nonrenewals that individually or in the aggregate have not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any Company Permit, or result
in any termination, modification or nonrenewal thereof, except in each case
for any such violations, terminations, modifications or nonrenewals that
individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

or specific authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to

accepted accounting principals and to maintain accountability for assets, (c)

producing oil and gas wells included in the Company Reserve Report have been

material extent, under gas balancing or similar arrangements.   (e) The

thereunder have been properly and timely paid and there is no existing
default (or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under any of such oil and gas leases or other agreements, except, in
each case, as individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   (f) No claim, notice or order from any Governmental Entity
or other Person has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
due to Hydrocarbon production in excess of allowables or similar violations
that could result in curtailment of production after the Closing Date from

Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.22 Investment Company. Neither

incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation
right or other equity-based incentive, severance, termination, change in
control, retention, employment, hospitalization or other medical, life or
other insurance, disability, other welfare, supplemental unemployment,
profit-sharing, pension or retirement plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, and each other director or employee compensation or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, sponsored, maintained or contributed
to by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or by any trade or business, whether or
not incorporated (a "Parent ERISA Affiliate"), that together with Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, or to which Parent or a Parent ERISA
Affiliate is party, whether written or oral, for the benefit of any current
or former officer, employee or director of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Parent ERISA Affiliate (the "Parent Plans").   (b) With respect to each
Parent Plan, Parent has heretofore delivered to the Company complete and
correct copies of each of the following documents (including all amendments
to such documents), as applicable:   (i) the Parent Plan or a written
description of any Parent  Plan not in writing;   (ii) a copy of the most
recent annual report or Internal  Revenue Service Form 5500 Series, including
all related reports required  therewith;   (iii) a copy of the most recent
Summary Parent Plan  Description ("Parent SPD"), together with all Summaries

other material  employee communications relating to each Parent Plan
distributed by Parent  or any of its Subsidiaries from December 31, 2003 to

and   (vii) all material communications between Parent or any  Parent ERISA

the date hereof is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA. No liability
under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by Parent or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that would be reasonably likely to result in Parent or any Parent
ERISA Affiliate incurring any such liability, other than liability for
premiums due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have
been paid when due). Insofar as the representation made in this Section
4.9(c) applies to Sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, such
representation is made with respect to any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which Parent or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make, contributions during
the five-year period ending on the last day of the most recent plan year
ended prior to the Closing Date.   (d) None of Parent, any Parent ERISA
Affiliate, any of the Parent Plans, any trust created thereunder and, to the
knowledge of Parent, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
transaction or has taken or failed to take any action with respect to a
Parent Plan in connection with which Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate would be reasonably likely to be subject to a civil
penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed
pursuant to Section 4975(a) or (b), 4976 or 4980B of the Code.   (e) All
contributions required to be made by Parent and its Subsidiaries with respect
to any Parent Plan on or prior to the Closing Date have been timely made or
are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent dated as of
September 30, 2004 contained in the Specified Parent SEC Documents. Since
September 30, 2004, there has been no amendment to, written interpretation of
or announcement (whether or not written) by Parent or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in the terms of employee participation or
coverage under, any Parent Plan that would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such Parent Plan above the level of expense incurred in respect
thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

its Subsidiaries in all material respects in accordance with applicable Laws,

the Code, Parent has received a currently effective determination letter from
the IRS stating that it is so qualified, such letter has not been revoked,
and, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that would be
reasonably likely to affect such qualified status. No fund established under
a Parent Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code.   (h) No amounts payable under the Parent Plans as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby will fail to be deductible for federal
income Tax purposes by virtue of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.   (i)
No Parent Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization or similar benefits
(whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former employee of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate after retirement or
other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable
Law, (ii) death benefits under any "employee pension plan," as that term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits, the full direct cost of
which is borne by the current or former employee (or
beneficiary thereof).   (j) The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer or
director of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other similar termination
payment under any Parent Plan, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of, increase the amount of or otherwise enhance any benefit due any
such employee, officer or director under any Parent Plan.   (k) To the
knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has contributed to a
nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(c) of the Code)
and no Parent ERISA Affiliate or any of its Subsidiaries has incurred a Tax
under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or could become a liability of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.   (l) There is no pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened material Litigation by, on behalf of or
against any Parent Plan by any participant (or beneficiary thereof) in such
Parent Plan or otherwise involving such Parent Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits).   Section 4.10 Litigation; Compliance with Law.  
(a) Except as disclosed in the Specified Parent SEC Documents, (i) there is
no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against, relating to or naming as a party thereto Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or assets or any
of Parent\'s officers or directors (in their capacities as such), (ii) there
is no agreement, order, judgment, decree, injunction or award of any
Governmental Entity against and/or binding upon Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of Parent\'s officers or directors (in their capacities
as such) that, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), individually or in
the aggregate has had, or would be reasonably likely to have or result in, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and (iii) there is no Litigation that
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has pending against other parties, where
such Litigation is intended to enforce or preserve material rights of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has
complied, and is in compliance, in all material respects with all Laws and
Permits which affect the respective businesses of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Parent Real Property and/or the Parent Assets, and Parent
and its Subsidiaries have not been and are not in violation in any material
respect of any such Law or Permit; nor has any notice, charge, claim or
action has been received by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or been filed,
commenced, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries alleging any violation of the foregoing.   (c) Parent and
its Subsidiaries hold all Permits necessary for the ownership, leasing,
operation, occupancy and use of the Parent Real Property, the Parent Assets
and the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted
("Parent Permits"), except where the failure to hold such Parent Permits
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any Parent Permit
will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and Parent has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such
termination, modification or nonrenewal, in each case except for any
such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals that individually or in
the aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or
result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any Parent
Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewal thereof,
except in each case for any such violations, terminations, modifications or
nonrenewals that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not
be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   (d) This Section 4.10 does not relate to matters with respect
to (i) Parent Plans, ERISA and other employee benefit matters (which are
the subject of Section 4.9), (ii) Tax Laws and other Tax matters (which are
the subject of Section 4.13), (iii) Environmental Laws and other

maintained to ensure in all material respects that (a) transactions are
executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorizations,
(b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals and to
maintain accountability for assets, (c) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization, (d) the

appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to

accountants. Parent has diligently completed in all material respects its SOX

and procedures for financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of SOX

Domestic Regional Reserve Estimates estimating Parent\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2003 (the

reserves set forth in the Parent Reserve Report was accurate in all material

(c) All material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from Parent
Oil and Gas Properties are being received by Parent and its Subsidiaries in a
timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason (except in
the ordinary course of business).   (d) Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any material advance, take-or-pay or other similar

material extent, under gas balancing or similar arrangements.   (e) Parent
and its Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all oil and gas
properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report as attributable to interests owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries and
free and clear of all Liens, except for (i) Permitted Liens and (ii) Liens
associated with obligations reflected in the Parent Reserve Report. The oil
and gas leases and other agreements that provide Parent and its Subsidiaries
with operating rights in the oil and gas properties reflected in the Parent
Reserve Report are legal, valid and binding and in full force and effect, and
the rentals, royalties and other payments due thereunder have been properly
and timely paid and there is no existing default (or event that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under any of such oil and
gas leases or other agreements, except, in each case, as individually or
in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or
result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (f) No claim, notice or
order from any Governmental Entity or other Person has been received by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries due to Hydrocarbon production in excess of
allowables or similar violations that could result in curtailment of
production after the Closing Date from any unit or oil and gas properties of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except any such violations which
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section
4.22 Investment Company. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
including Purchaser, is an "investment company," a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," or an "investment adviser" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act, or the Advisers Act.   Section 4.23 Interim
Operations of Purchaser. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of

as of the date of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration to be paid
by Parent in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent,
a signed copy of which opinion has been, or will promptly be, delivered to
the Company. Parent has received the approval of JPMorgan to permit the
inclusion of a copy of its written opinion in its entirety in the Proxy
Statement, subject to JPMorgan\'s review of the Proxy Statement.   Section

letter.   Section 4.28 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for

or by any representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not such representative is so authorized and whether or not such
representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company and the Company Board may take any actions described in clause
(ii) of this Section 5.3(a) with respect to a third party if at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote (x) the Company receives a
written Acquisition Proposal from such third party (and such Acquisition
Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
agents or other representatives) and (y) such proposal constitutes, or the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company shall not
deliver any information to such third party without entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
the Company\'s stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent
required by applicable Law.   (b) Neither (i) the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") nor (ii) shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries execute or enter into an Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Required Vote, and subject to the Company\'s compliance at all times with the
provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, in response to a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal (X) until four Business Days after the Company provides
written notice to Parent (a "Company Notice") advising Parent that the
Company Board or a committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and
identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal and (Y) if
during such four Business Day period, Parent proposes any alternative
transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this Agreement),
unless the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all
financial, legal, and regulatory terms and conditions of such alternative
transaction proposal) that such alternative transaction proposal is not at
least as favorable to the Company and its stockholders from a financial point
of view as the Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change in the
financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
Company Notice and a new four Business Day period under this
Section 5.3(b)).   (c) Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section
5.3(b), at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject
to the Company\'s compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section
5.3 and Section 5.6, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (A) of the definition thereof if
the Company Board (i) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and any other advisor it chooses to consult, that the
failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change is inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company, (ii) determines
in good faith that the reasons for making such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change are independent of any pending Acquisition Proposal and (iii) provides
written notice to Parent (a "Company Notice of Change") advising Parent that
the Company Board is contemplating making a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and specifying the material facts and information constituting the
basis for such contemplated determination; provided, however, that (x) the
Company Board may not make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change until
the third Business Day after receipt by Parent of the Company Notice of
Change and (y) during such three Business Day period, at the request of
Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes
or modifications to this Agreement which would allow the Company Board not to
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary
duties.   (d) Parent agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective officers,
directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
agents and other representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
information) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
disclose any non-public information or data relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition
Proposal or to any Person in contemplation of an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any Acquisition Agreement.
Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries
or by any representatives of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not such representative is so authorized and whether or not such
representative is purporting to act on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
and the Parent Board may take any actions described in clause (ii) of this
Section 5.3(d) with respect to a third party if at any time prior to
obtaining the Required Parent Vote (x) Parent receives a written Acquisition
Proposal from such third party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not
initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other
representatives) and (y) such proposal constitutes, or the Parent Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) that such proposal could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, provided that Parent shall not deliver any
information to such third party without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall
prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from taking and disclosing to Parent\'s
stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable
Law.   (e) Neither (i) the Parent Board nor any committee thereof
shall directly or indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to the Company), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify
in a manner adverse to the Company), the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Parent Board or any such committee thereof
of this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Parent Proposal or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change") nor (ii) shall Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Required
Parent Vote, and subject to Parent\'s compliance at all times with the
provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, in response to a Superior
Proposal, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal (X) until four Business Days after Parent provides written
notice to the Company (a "Parent Notice") advising the Company that the
Parent Board or a committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and
identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal and (Y) if
during such four Business Day period, the Company proposes any alternative
transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this Agreement),
unless the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all
financial, legal, and regulatory terms and conditions of such alternative
transaction proposal) that such alternative transaction proposal is not at
least as favorable to Parent and its stockholders from a financial point of
view as the Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change in the
financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
Parent Notice and a new four Business Day period under this Section
5.3(e)).   (f) Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 5.3(e), at
any time prior to obtaining the Required Parent Vote, and subject to
Parent\'s compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and
Section 5.6, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
described in clause (A) of the definition thereof after the Parent Board (i)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and any other advisor it chooses to consult, that the failure to make such
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change is inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Parent, (ii) determines in good faith that the
reasons for making such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change are independent
of any pending Acquisition Proposal and (iii) provides written notice to the
Company (a "Parent Notice of Change") advising the Company that the Parent
Board is contemplating making a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and
specifying the material facts and information constituting the basis for such
contemplated determination; provided, however, that (x) the Parent Board may
not make such a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change until the third Business
Day after receipt by the Company of the Parent Notice of Change and (y)
during such three Business Day period, at the request of the Company, Parent
shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes or modifications to
this Agreement which would allow the Parent Board not to make such Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary duties.   (g)
The Parties agree that in addition to the obligations of the Company and
Parent set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this Section 5.3, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, the Company or Parent,
as applicable, shall advise Parent or the Company, respectively, in writing
of any request for information or any Acquisition Proposal received from any
Person, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and the terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company
or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly provide to Parent or the Company,
respectively, copies of any written materials received by the Company or
Parent, as applicable, in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the Person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place.
Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to
the other any non-public information concerning itself or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal which was not previously provided to the other. The Company and
Parent shall keep Parent and the Company, respectively, fully informed of the
status of any Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the parties
and price involved and any changes to any material terms and conditions
thereof). Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to release any third
party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it is a party.   (h) For purposes of this Agreement, with
respect a party hereto, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
proposal, whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that constitutes 10% or more
of the net revenues, net income or the assets (based on the fair market value
thereof) of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 10% or more of any class of equity
securities or capital stock of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries whose
business constitutes 10% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of
such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) merger,
consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer,
recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that
if consummated would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning 10%
or more of any class of equity securities of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 10% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
for purposes of this Agreement, with respect to Parent, any transaction (or
proposal with respect thereto) that is described in Section 5.2(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not constitute an Acquisition Proposal. The
term "Superior Proposal" shall mean, with respect to a party hereto, any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a third party to acquire (which
term shall include a parent to parent merger or other business combination
with a similar result), directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business
combination, (A) 50% or more of the assets of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 50% or more of the equity
securities of such party, in each case on terms which a majority of the board
of directors of such party determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all
financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal and this Agreement, including any alternative transaction (including
any modifications to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by any other party
in response to such Superior Proposal, including any conditions to and
expected timing of consummation, and any risks of non-consummation, of such
Acquisition Proposal) to be superior to such party and its stockholders (in
their capacity as stockholders) from a financial point of view as compared to
the transactions contemplated hereby and to any alternative transaction
(including any modifications to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by any
other party hereto pursuant to this Section 5.3.   (i) Immediately after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to,
cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal. Each party agrees that it shall (i) take the necessary steps to
promptly inform its officers, directors, investments bankers, attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives involved in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 5.3 and (ii) request each Person who has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement in connection with such Person\'s consideration
of acquiring such party or any portion thereof to return or destroy (which
destruction shall be certified in writing by an executive officer of such
Person) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on its behalf.   Section 5.4 Access to Information and Properties.  
(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives
of the other party, including officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its
properties, contracts, books, commitments, records, data and books
and personnel and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other parties all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other parties may
reasonably request. No party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.   (b) From the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party and its authorized
representatives, including engineers, advisors and consultants, lenders and
financing sources, upon reasonable notice and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the business of the applicable party or any of
its Subsidiaries, may enter into and upon all or any portion of the real
property owned or leased by the other party in order to investigate and
assess, as such party reasonably deems necessary or appropriate,
the environmental condition of such real property and the other assets or
the businesses of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries (an
"Investigation"). An Investigation may include a Phase I environmental site
assessment, or similar investigation; provided, however, that an
Investigation shall not include any sampling or testing of soil and/or ground
or surface waters at, on or under any real property. Each party hereto shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the other parties
in conducting any such Investigation, facilitating further testing or
evaluation as may be reasonably prudent with respect to matters identified in
the investigation, allow any other party reasonable access to such party\'s
and its Subsidiaries\' respective businesses, real property and other assets,
together with full permission to conduct any such Investigation, and provide
to any other party all plans, soil or surface or ground water tests or
reports, any environmental investigation results, reports or assessments
previously or contemporaneously conducted or prepared by or on behalf of such
party, its Subsidiaries, or any of their predecessors that are in the
possession of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, and all information
relating to environmental matters regarding such party\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' respective businesses, real property and other assets that are
in the possession of such party or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c) Parent
and the Company will hold any information contemplated under Sections 5.4(a)
and/or (b) above in accordance with the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as of August 9, 2004 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"); provided, however, that each party\'s
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate on the
earlier of (i) the date provided therein or (ii) the Effective Time.   (d)
No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
other set forth in this Agreement.   Section 5.5 Further Action; Reasonable
Best Efforts.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions
precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto, to obtain all
necessary authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings, and to assist Parent and Purchaser in obtaining
the Financing. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other parties
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other parties
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and will provide the
other parties with copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (b) Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
under any applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall, as soon as practicable, file Notification and Report Forms
under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division")
and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to all inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for
additional information or documentation.   (c) Each party shall (i) take all
actions necessary to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover
Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be required to take any action to exempt any shareholder of the
Company from any such Law.   (d) In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, the proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall take or cause to be taken all such necessary action.  
(e) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order
or injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining
or prohibiting consummation of the Merger.   (f) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall
be required to accept, as a condition to obtaining any required approval or
resolving any objection of any Governmental Entity, any requirement to divest
or hold separate or in trust (or the imposition of any other condition or
restriction with respect to) any of the respective businesses of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, the Company
Assets, the Parent Assets, the Company Real Property or the Parent Real
Property.   Section 5.6 Proxy Statement; Form S-4; Stockholders\'
Meeting.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and each
shall cause to be filed with the SEC, in connection with the Merger, a joint
proxy statement in preliminary form (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and Parent shall promptly prepare
and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included
as a prospectus, and the parties shall file, if necessary, any other
statement or schedule relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required
to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the S-4 and any such
statement or schedule. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and each of the
Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable thereafter mail the Proxy
Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall also use reasonable best efforts
to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
or circumstance relating to the Company, Parent and Purchaser or any of
their respective affiliates, or its or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Purchaser that
should be set forth in an amendment to the S-4 or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company, Parent or Purchaser shall promptly inform the other
parties hereto thereof in writing. All documents that the Company or Parent
is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein will comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The
parties shall notify each other promptly of the time when the S-4 has become
effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC
or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
or the S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of
the SEC relating to the S-4.   (c) The Company, acting through the Company
Board, shall, in accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and with applicable Law, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold, as soon as practicable following the date upon which the S-4 becomes
effective for the purposes of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, a special meeting of its stockholders for
the sole purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (such
meeting, including any postponement or adjournment thereof, the "Company
Special Meeting"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the
Company Special Meeting no later than 45 days after such date. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.3(b) or 5.3(c), the Company, acting through
the Company Board, shall (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement and include
in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption. Notwithstanding any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other fact or
circumstance, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Special Meeting for the purpose of adopting this
Agreement, with such disclosures as shall be required by applicable Law. At
any such Company Special Meeting following any such withdrawal, amendment or
modification of the Company Board\'s recommendation of this Agreement, the
Company may submit this Agreement to its stockholders without a
recommendation or with a negative recommendation (although the approval of
this Agreement by the Company Board may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation or negative recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.   (d) Parent,
acting through the Parent Board, shall, in accordance with its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly and duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable following the date
upon which the S-4 becomes effective for the purposes of voting upon the
Parent Proposal a special meeting of its stockholders (such meeting,
including any postponements or adjournments thereof, the "Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold
the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting no later than 45 days after such date.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3(e) or 5.3(f), Parent, acting
through the Parent Board, shall (i) recommend approval of the Parent Proposal
and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such approval. Notwithstanding
any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent of any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other fact
or circumstance, the Parent Proposal shall be submitted to the stockholders
of Parent at the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting for the purpose of approval of
the Parent Proposal, with such disclosures as shall be required by applicable
Law. At any such Parent Stockholders\' Meeting following any such withdrawal,
amendment or modification of the Parent Board\'s recommendation of the Parent
Proposal, Parent may submit the Parent Proposal to its stockholders without a
recommendation or with a negative recommendation (although the approval of
the Parent Proposal by the Parent Board may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Parent Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation or negative recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.   Section 5.7
Notification of Certain Matters. (a) The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any fact, event or circumstance as to which the Company obtains
knowledge that would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b). Parent and Purchaser shall
give prompt notice to the Company of any fact, event or circumstance as to
which Parent or Purchaser obtains knowledge that would be reasonably likely
to result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
6.2(b).   (b) Immediately prior to Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with a complete list of the number of employee terminations
(other than voluntary resignations and terminations for cause) for the 90-day
period prior to Closing, by facility or geographic site of employment.  
Section 5.8 Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance and Indemnification.   (a)
After the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in such capacities ("Indemnified
Parties") to the fullest extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
would have been required to do so in accordance with the provisions of each
indemnification or similar agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party, in each case against any losses,
damages, expenses or liabilities resulting from any claim, liability, loss,
damage, cost or expense, asserted against, or incurred by, an
Indemnified Party that is based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) take all
necessary actions to ensure that Parent\'s director\'s and officer\'s
liability insurance continues to cover each Company Director and each officer
and director of the Company, in each case so long as they remain employed or
retained by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including the Surviving
Corporation) as an officer or director and, to the extent Parent\'s current
director\'s and officer\'s liability insurance policy covers consultants, as
a consultant, on terms that are no less favorable as those enjoyed by
Parent\'s other directors and officers.   (b) Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall purchase, and after the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
covering, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are currently covered by
the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the
Effective Time, on terms and conditions no less favorable to such directors
and officers than those in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time
during such period shall not exceed 175% of the per annum rate of premium
currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance on the
date of this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that in the event that
such insurance cannot be obtained for 175% of the per annum rate of premium
currently paid by the Company, Parent shall nonetheless be obligated to
provide such directors\' and officers\' liability insurance as may be
obtained for such sum.   Section 5.9 Publicity. Neither the Company,
Parent, Purchaser nor any of their respective affiliates shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to
the Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior consultation of the other party, except as may be
required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange if all reasonable best efforts have been made to consult with the
other party.   Section 5.10 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, as of the Effective Time.   Section 5.11
Employee Benefits. (a) During the period from the Closing Date until the six
month anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide to each Person who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Continuing
Employees") compensation (including base salary and incentive and bonus
opportunities, but excluding equity-based compensation) and
benefits (including vacation, paid time-off and severance) that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the
Continuing Employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time.   (b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries
for purposes of each Parent Plan (including vacation, paid time-off and
severance plans) in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels and accruals (other than defined benefit pension plan
accruals).   (c) Following the Effective Time, for purposes of each
Parent Plan in which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible
dependents is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition,
exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period to the extent such
condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Plan as of the Effective Time(or, if later, any
applicable plan transaction date) and (ii) provide full credit for any co-
payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the
Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such
transition date) occurs.   (d) Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each Company Plan and
all obligations thereunder, including any rights or benefits arising as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other event), and Parent hereby acknowledges that the
consummation of the Merger constitutes a change of control or change in
control, as the case may be, for all purposes under such Company Plans.  
(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall be entitled to amend and modify the Company\'s
Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Select Employees (the
"Existing Deferred Compensation Plan") and the Company\'s 2005
Deferred Compensation Plan for Select Employees (together with the Existing
Deferred Compensation Plan, the "Deferred Compensation Plans"), in each case,
solely to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code and
any rules, regulations or other guidance promulgated thereunder by any
Governmental Entity.   (f) Following the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective officers or employees to, take any action (including the waiver of
any term or condition of either Deferred Compensation Plan) that results, or
would be reasonably likely to result, in the imposition of any Tax or
interest penalty under Section 409A of the Code on any current or former
participant in either Deferred Compensation Plan, including any "material
modification" (within the meaning of Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004) of the Existing Deferred Compensation Plan with
respect to amounts deferred in taxable years beginning before January 1,
2005, and (ii) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers and employees to, take all actions (including any
amendment or modification of either Deferred Compensation Plan) necessary to
ensure that each Deferred Compensation Plan complies, by its terms and in its
operation, with any rules, regulations or other guidance promulgated under
Section 409A of the Code by any Governmental Entity after the date hereof;
provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of clause (ii) shall not
apply (A) in the event that there is no such action that could be taken that
would ensure such compliance, in which case Parent shall so notify the
participants in such Deferred Compensation Plan in order that they may have
the opportunity to challenge such fact, or (B) to the extent that such action
is necessary to cause such Deferred Compensation Plan to comply with Section
409A of the Code or any rule, regulation or other guidance promulgated
thereunder by any Governmental Entity as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, further, however, that Parent shall be entitled to
amend or modify the New Deferred Compensation Plan to provide that (A) no
additional amounts will be contributed to or deferred under the New Deferred
Compensation Plan and (B) to the extent no Tax or interest penalty under
Section 409A of the Code would be imposed on any participant therein, amounts
previously contributed to or deferred under the New Deferred Compensation
Plan will be distributed to the participants therein, in each case subject to
the requirements of Section 5.11(a). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
each current and former participant in either Deferred Compensation Plan on
an after-Tax basis from any Tax or interest penalty imposed under Section
409A of the Code (or any successor or replacement provision thereto) to the
extent imposed as a result of any failure of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
