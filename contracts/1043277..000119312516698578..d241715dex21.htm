   11. | Warranty, Indemnity and Tax Claims 
---|--- 



   11.1 | Notice of potential Warranty or Indemnity Claim 
---|--- 

As soon as possible after a party first becomes aware of anything which it is
aware is or may be reasonably likely to give rise to a Warranty Claim or an
Indemnity Claim:



     | (a) | it must notify the other parties in writing of that fact,
together with all available details; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Vendors must, as and when requested by the Purchaser,
provide to the Purchaser any information and details which the Purchaser
reasonably requires. 
---|---|--- 
 



   11.2 | Effect of payment 
---|--- 

A payment to the Purchaser for a Warranty Claim or an Indemnity Claim is to
be treated as a reduction in the Purchase Price.

  ME_130835635_20 (W2013) |  | ---|--- 

Other than in respect of Title Subject Claims and Tax Subject Claims, the
Vendors have no liability for a Warranty Claim or an Indemnity Claim until the
aggregate of all those Claims exceeds $500,000, in which event the Purchaser
may claim the whole amount.

 



   11.4 | Time limits on Claims 
---|--- 

Other than in respect of Title Subject Claims, the Vendors have no liability
for a Warranty Claim or an Indemnity Claim, unless:



     | (a) | in the case of a Warranty Claim or an Indemnity Claim
(except for a Tax Subject Claim or an Indemnity Claim pursuant to clause 9.2),
the Purchaser has given written notice of the Claim to the Vendors on or
before the third anniversary of the Completion Date; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | in the case of a Tax Subject Claim or an Indemnity Claim
pursuant to clause 9.2, the Purchaser has given written notice of the Claim to
the Vendors on or before the seventh anniversary of the Completion Date.  
---|---|--- 



   11.5 | Maximum aggregate liability for Claims 
---|--- 

Other than in respect of Title Subject Claims, the maximum aggregate
liability of the Vendors for all Claims made by the Purchaser under this
agreement is equal to the Purchase Price.



   11.6 | Gross-up for Tax 
---|--- 

If the Vendors are liable to pay an amount to the Purchaser or any Group
Company pursuant to a Warranty Claim or an Indemnity Claim and:



     | (a) | any such payment is assessable under the Tax Act such that
the payment increases the Tax payable by, or reduces any Tax Relief available
to, the Purchaser or a Group Company under the Tax Act; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | as a consequence of the receipt of a payment referred to in
clause 11.6(a), an amount of taxable income arises to the Purchaser or a Group
Company under the Tax Act, 
---|---|--- 
 

then in addition to the payment by the Vendors of the amount pursuant to the
Warranty Claim or Indemnity Claim (as the case may be), the Vendors must
promptly pay to the Purchaser or Group Company, as the case requires, such
additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the Purchaser or Group
Company, as the case requires, is compensated for the value of the Tax Relief
lost, or that the net amount retained by the Purchaser or the Group Company,
as the case requires, after deduction of Tax or payment of the increased
income tax, equals the amount the Purchaser or the Group Company, as the case
requires, would have retained had the Tax or increased income tax not been
payable or the Tax relief not been lost.



   11.7 | Conduct of Third Party Claims 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Vendors, subject to this clause 11.7 and clause 11.8,
may, in respect of a Third Party Claim notified by the Purchaser under clause
11.1, by written notice to the Purchaser within 10 Business Days of receipt of
a Claim Notice inform the Purchaser that they either: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | elect to take over the conduct of the Third Party Claim; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | do not elect to take over conduct of the Third Party Claim. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Vendors may only seek to take over the conduct of the
Third Party Claim if they have, by written notice to the Purchaser,
unconditionally accepted liability for the corresponding Warranty Claim or
Indemnity Claim (as the case may be). 
---|---|--- 



   11.8 | If Vendors conduct Third Party Claim 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Where the Vendors elect to take over the conduct and/or
defence of a Third Party Claim in accordance with clause 11.7: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Vendors: 
---|---|---

against all Liabilities suffered, paid or incurred by the Purchaser or any
Group Company arising out of the conduct of the Third Party Claim, including
the conduct of the Vendors under this clause 11.8 and from anything done or
not done by the Purchaser or any Group Company in order to comply with this
clause 11.8 or acts or omissions required or requested of the Purchaser or any
Group Company in respect of the same, as and when they fall due. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Nothing in clause 11.1 or this clause 11.8 requires the
Purchaser (acting reasonably) to allow the Vendors to have access to anything
that is the subject of legal professional privilege or has been prepared for
the purposes of, or in contemplation of, the Purchaser making a Claim against
the Vendors under this agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   11.9 | If Vendors do not conduct the Third Party Claim 
---|--- 

If the Vendors do not notify the Purchaser of their election within the
period specified in clause 11.7(a):



     | (a) | they are taken to have elected to not take over the conduct

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Purchaser may conduct the Third Party Claim in its
absolute discretion;

If:

 



     | (a) | the Purchaser or any Group Company receives any payment from
or on behalf of the Vendors for any Warranty Claim or Indemnity Claim other
than from the Escrow Agent (Vendor Payment) and the Purchaser or any
Group Company subsequently recovers any amount from the Escrow Agent or any
other Third Party (including under a Third Party Claim) for anything causing
that Warranty Claim or Indemnity Claim (as the case may be) (Recovered
Amount); and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if the Recovered Amount, when aggregated with the Vendor
Payment, exceeds the Purchasers and any Group Companys total Liabilities in
respect of the facts, matters or circumstances giving rise to the
Warranty Claim or Indemnity Claim (the amount of such excess being the
Excess), 
---|---|--- 

the Purchaser must promptly:

 



     | (c) | notify the Vendors of the Recovered Amount; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | pay the Vendors an amount equal to the lesser of: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Excess less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by the Purchaser or any Group Company (as the case may be) in making that

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | the amount of the Tax Claim (where known); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | a description in reasonable detail of the nature of the Tax
Claim; and

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Failure by the Purchaser to notify, or to procure that the
Company notifies, the Vendors of a Tax Claim in accordance with this clause
11.11 does not prevent the Purchaser from making a Tax Subject Claim under
this agreement, however the Vendors liability for the Tax Subject Claim will
be reduced to the extent that any failure by the Purchaser to comply with this
clause 11.11 has directly increased the amount of the Tax Subject Claim. 
---|---|--- 
 



   11.12 | Tax Claims process 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to clause 11.12(c), the Purchaser will have the sole
control of the conduct of any action to dispute, defend, object to, contest,
appeal, compromise or settle a Tax Claim, and shall be free to pay or settle
the Tax Claim on such reasonable terms as the Purchaser determines, provided
that it must consult with and use its reasonable endeavours to agree with the
Vendors the optimal approach to favourably settling the Tax Claim with the Tax
Authority.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Purchaser agrees to keep the Vendors fully informed of
any proposed conduct under clause 11.12(a) and provide the Vendors with
sufficient time for the Vendors to determine whether or not the Vendors agree
with any proposed course of action. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Where the Vendors provide the Purchaser with written notice
of their disagreement with a proposed course of action under clause 11.12(a),
subject to the Vendors indemnifying and securing the Purchaser against
all Liabilities which may be incurred (including any additional Tax), the
Purchaser may take such action as the Vendors reasonably request in disputing,
defending, objecting to, contesting, appealing, compromising or settling the
Tax Claim.

     | (d) | The Vendors must deliver each Pre-Completion Return and

dispute were a dispute in relation to a Tax Claim.

   14.5 | Interpretation 
---|--- 

Clauses 14.2, 14.3 and 14.4 have effect together as if they consisted
of separate provisions, each being severable from the other. Each separate
provision results from combining each undertaking in clause 14.2, with each
period in clause 14.3, and combining each of those combinations with each area
in clause 14.4. If any of those separate provisions is invalid or
unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability does not
affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other separate provisions
or other combinations of the separate provisions of clauses 14.2, 14.3 and
14.4.



   14.6 | Exceptions 
---|--- 

This clause 14 does not restrict a Prohibited Person from:

 



     | (a) | performing any employment agreement with the Group; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | holding 5% or less of the shares of a listed company; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | recruiting a person through a recruitment agency (except if
the agency targets employees of the Group) or in a response to a newspaper,
web page or other public employment advertisement. 
---|---|--- 
 



   14.7 | Acknowledgments 
---|--- 

Each Vendor acknowledges that:

 



     | (a) | all the prohibitions and restrictions in this clause 14 are
reasonable in the circumstances and necessary to protect the goodwill of the
Business; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | damages are not an adequate remedy if a Prohibited Person
breaches this clause 14; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Purchaser may apply for injunctive relief if: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | a Prohibited Person breaches or threatens to breach this
clause 14; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | it believes a Prohibited Person is likely to breach this
clause 14. 
---|---|--- 



   15. | Confidentiality and publicity 
---|--- 



   15.1 | Confidentiality 
---|--- 

A party (Recipient):

 



     | (a) | must keep confidential any confidential information of
another party (Disclosing Party) disclosed to the Recipient by the Disclosing
Party, or of which the Recipient becomes aware, at any time up to
Completion, except information which is public knowledge otherwise than as a
result of a breach of confidentiality by the Recipient or any of its permitted
disclosees; and
