(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within thirty (30) calendar days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing Date Statement") setting forth its
good faith calculations of (i) Net Working Capital as of the close of business

and its representatives reasonable access to the records, properties,
personnel and (subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters
if requested) auditors of the Company relating to the preparation of the
Closing Date Statement and shall cause the personnel of the Company to
reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with its review of the Closing
Date Statement.

(b) If Seller shall disagree with any aspect of the Closing Date Statement
(including the calculations or the amounts set forth therein), it shall notify
Buyer of such disagreement in writing (the "Objection"), setting forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within thirty (30)
days after its receipt of the Closing Date Statement. In the event that Seller
does not provide an Objection within such thirty (30) day period, Seller shall
be deemed to have accepted the Closing Date Statement and the calculations and
amounts set forth therein, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder. In the event an Objection is timely provided, Buyer
and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the Closing Date Statement. If, at the end of
such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Grant
Thornton LLP (or such independent accounting or financial consulting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Seller)
(the "Auditor") shall resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall
be instructed to resolve solely those matters specified in the Objection. The
Auditor shall investigate only those items which are in dispute and shall not
assign a value to any item that is (A) greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by either of Buyer or Seller or (B) lower than the lowest
value for such item claimed by either of Buyer or Seller. The Auditor's
determination shall be based only upon written submissions by Buyer and
Seller, and not upon an independent review by the Auditor. The Parties shall
instruct the Auditor to render its determination within thirty (30) days of
the referral of such matter thereto, and the determination of the Auditor
shall be final, binding and non-appealable upon all parties for all purposes
of this Agreement. None of Seller, Buyer or the Company shall have any ex
parte communications or meetings with the Auditor without the prior consent of
Buyer (in the case of Seller) or Seller (in the case of Buyer or the Company).
The fees, costs and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid (i) by Seller if the
items covered thereby are resolved in favor of Buyer or (ii) by Buyer if the
items covered thereby are resolved in favor of the Objection. If the items
referred to therein are resolved in part in favor of the Objection and in part
in favor of Buyer, such fees, costs and expenses shall be allocated between
Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as Seller and Buyer may prevail on
matters resolved by the Auditor, which proportionate allocations shall be
determined by the Auditor; provided, however, that Seller shall be considered
the prevailing party with respect to any matter resolved by the Auditor if the
Objection giving rise thereto resulted from Buyer's failure to provide Seller
with the records, properties, personnel and auditors back-up or supporting
data relating to the preparation of the Closing Date Statement reasonably and
timely requested by Seller in accordance with this Section 2.5. The date on
which all disputed amounts set forth in the Closing Date Statement are finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.5(b) is hereinafter referred to
as the "Determination Date."

(c) Final Purchase Price. As used in this Agreement, the "Final Purchase
Price" means an amount equal to (i) the Enterprise Value, plus (ii) the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount if a positive number, minus (iii) the
absolute value of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount if a negative
number, plus (iv) Company Cash as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, minus (v) Company Debt as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date minus (vi) the
Seller Transaction Expenses, in each case of clauses (ii) - (vi) as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.5.

(d) Final Adjustment Payment. No later than the fifth Business Day following
(i) the acceptance of the Closing Statement by Seller or (ii) the
Determination Date, as applicable, if:

(i) the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, (x)
Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated pursuant to Section
2.3(a)(i)(A) or such other account as may be designated by Seller and (y) each
of Buyer and Seller shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the entire amount of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to the account designated pursuant to Section
2.3(a)(i)(A) or such other account as may be designated by Seller;

(ii) the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the
amount of the difference, the "Deficit Amount"), each of Buyer and Seller
shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent (x) if the Deficit Amount is less than the Purchase Price
Adjustment Funds, to disburse the Deficit Amount from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account to an account(s) designated in writing by Buyer and
the remainder of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account to Seller to the
account designated pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(i)(A) or such other account as
may be designated by Seller or (y) if the Deficit Amount is greater than the
Purchase Price Adjustment Funds, to disburse (1) the entire amount of Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account and (2) the amount of the shortfall from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, in each case of clauses (1) and (2) to an account(s)
designated in writing by Buyer; or

(iii) the Final Purchase Price equals the Estimated Purchase Price, each of
Buyer and Seller shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the entire amount of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to the account designated pursuant to Section
2.3(a)(i)(A) or such other account as may be designated by Seller.

recourse for payment of the Deficit Amount shall be the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds and the Indemnity Escrow Funds, in each case as
provided in Section 2.5(d), and neither Buyer nor the Company nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any claim against Seller or any of its
Affiliates in respect thereof.

of the Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery by Seller of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under (i) any provision
of Seller's certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement,
(ii) any Order applicable to Seller or its properties or assets, or (iii) any
Applicable Law applicable to Seller, or (b) give rise to any right of

to Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

proceedings pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened against or affecting

which, if adversely determined, would materially impair Seller's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and there are no outstanding
Orders of any Governmental Authority affecting Seller or its respective
properties or assets, at law or in equity, which would materially impair

press release.

6.6 Filings and Authorizations; Consummation.

(e) Each of the parties hereto shall, within five (5) Business Days of the
date hereof, file or supply, cause to be filed or supplied, all notifications
and information required to be filed or supplied pursuant to the HSR Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein. Each of the parties

(c) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing
if, to the Company's Knowledge, there shall be (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event which has caused any of its or the Company's
representations or warranties contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in
any respect and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder. Should any such event, fact or condition require any change to the
Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer a supplement to
the Disclosure Schedule specifying such change. In the event that Seller
delivers one or more supplements to the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this
Section 6.7(a) that reflect any events, facts or conditions which individually
or in the aggregate would cause the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or
7.2(b) not to be satisfied, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to that effect (specifying the basis for such
termination) within five (5) Business Days of Buyer's receipt of any
supplement to the Disclosure Schedule (with such termination being Buyer's
sole and exclusive remedy relating to matters set forth in such supplemented
Disclosure Schedule); provided that, if Buyer does not exercise such right to
terminate this Agreement, (x) Buyer will be deemed to have accepted such
supplemented Disclosure Schedule, (y) the delivery of any such supplement will
be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that
otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such events, fact or
condition and (z) from and after the Closing Date, Buyer will not have any
claim for indemnification for any such events, facts or conditions.

(d) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing
if Buyer becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or
the existence of any fact or condition that would cause or constitute a breach
of any of its representations or warranties had any such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of Buyer's discovery of such event, fact or
condition and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it 6.8 Officer and Director Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Company's articles of organization or limited liability company agreement to
include provisions providing for the elimination of liability and for
mandatory indemnification of current and former directors and officers and
reimbursement of expenses in connection therewith that are no less favorable
to such persons to the provisions contained in the Company's articles of
organization or limited liability company agreement as of the date of this
Agreement and shall not amend any such provisions or amend or terminate any
indemnification agreement with such Persons in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, except (in the case of amendments) in a manner more favorable to
such Persons except as may be required by law or regulation.

(b) At or prior to Closing, the Company will purchase and pay for in full
effective as of the Closing, a non-cancelable tail policy to the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance set forth on Section 3.25(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule, maintained on the date of this Agreement by the
Company, which tail policy (i) shall be effective for a period from the
Closing through and including the date six (6) years after the Closing with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior
to or at the Closing and (ii) shall contain coverage that is at least as
protective to the Persons covered by such existing policies. The Buyer will
cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with the Company and Seller with
respect to maintaining or processing claims under any such tail policy and
will be responsible for paying 50% of the premium for such policy.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the current and former directors and
officers of the Company.

(d) If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

6.9 Tax Covenants.

(f) Any refund, rebate, abatement, credit or other recovery of Taxes of the
Company and any interest thereon paid by the applicable taxing authority to
the Company (less any Taxes, costs or expenses incurred by the Company with
respect thereto) (collectively, a "Tax Refund") with respect to all taxable
years or periods that end on or before the Closing Date (including the pre-
Closing portion of the year that includes the Closing Date as determined on a
closing of the books basis) shall be for the account of Seller, and shall be
paid by the Company, to Seller within ten (10) days of receipt, or the filing
of the Tax Return that contains a credit or other offset in lieu of any other
such Tax Refund.

(g) Without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, after the Closing the Company shall not file any Tax
Return (including any amended Tax Return) with respect to any period that ends
on or before the Closing Date. (h) Seller shall provide Buyer with its proposed allocation (the "Allocation")
of the Purchase Price plus the assumed liabilities and other relevant items
within 120 days following the Closing Date and Buyer shall respond within 90
days of receipt, providing either (i) its acceptance of such allocation or
(ii) any objections, in which case Buyer shall also provide its determination
of the allocation of the Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree to act in good
faith to resolve any differences between them. In the event that agreement
cannot be reached, the parties will jointly choose an independent certified
public accounting firm, whose decision shall be final. The costs of such firm
shall be shared equally between Seller and Buyer. The Allocation shall be
revised from time to time, in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code, to take into account any increase or decrease to the Purchase Price on
account of any adjustment. Seller and Buyer agree that such Allocation shall
be used by each of them in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594, or any successor form), and each party agrees that
it shall take no position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position,
inconsistent with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any proceeding before
any Governmental Authority. Buyer and Seller agree to treat the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as the purchase of a group of assets that
constitute a trade or business, for the purposes of federal and state income
tax purposes and shall cooperate in preparing, signing and filing all income
and other Tax Returns relating to the purchase and sale of the Company
Interests. Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide to the other, upon request,
a copy of IRS Form 8594, including all exhibits relating thereto, prepared by
it, together with any amendments, supplements, updates or revisions.

6.10 No Solicitation or Negotiation. Each of Seller and the Company agrees
that between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, neither Seller
nor the Company will (i) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any
other proposals or offers from any Person (other than Buyer and its
Affiliates) (A) relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any portion
of the equity of the Company or all or a substantial portion of the assets of
the Company, (B) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other business
combination with the Company or (C) to enter into a recapitalization,
reorganization or any other extraordinary business transaction involving or
otherwise relating to the Company or (ii) participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications regarding, or furnish to
any other Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to
do any of the foregoing. Seller and the Company immediately shall cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations
and other communications with any Persons (other than Buyer and its
affiliates) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

6.11 Employees.

(k) For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Buyer will cause the
Company to provide for any employee of the Company who is an employee of the
Company as of the Closing Date (to the extent such employee remains as an
employee of the Company during such period) (each, a "Company Employee"), at
least the same wage rate or cash salary and target bonus opportunity level in
effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing and employee
benefit plans, fringe and other benefits (excluding stock option and other
stock or phantom stock related compensation) that are of the same or substantially the same
value, in the aggregate, as those in effect immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, that nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted to be a
guarantee of continuing employment by the Company, the Buyer, or any of their
Affiliates following the Closing Date or continuing the Company's existing
401(k) Plan. As of and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give each Company Employee full credit for all
purposes under any Plan or Benefit Program or Agreement and each other
employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement, in each case maintained for the
benefit of the applicable Company Employees as of and after the Closing by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (the "Buyer Plans"), for such Company
Employee's service prior to the Closing with the Company, to the same extent
such service is recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing.
Each applicable Buyer Plan shall waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence
of insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations. To the
extent applicable in the plan year that contains the Closing Date, the Company
Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Buyer Plan for amounts
paid during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs under a
corresponding Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-
of-pocket maximums, as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Buyer Plan. For a period of thirty-six (36)
months following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that the offices of the
Company shall not be relocated from the location of such offices as of the
Closing Date.

(l) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will take all necessary and
appropriate action to freeze and terminate, effective as of a date prior to
the Closing Date, the Company's existing 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") and
shall provide evidence of the same to Seller at the Closing.

6.12 Payoff Letters. By no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer copies of Payoff Letters for the
Company Debt listed in Section 6.12 of the Disclosure Schedule.

6.13 Management Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company
shall take such action as may be necessary to cause the Management Agreement
to be terminated without any penalty, cost or consideration to be payable or
incurred by the Company following the Closing and all payments thereunder to
be made prior to the Closing and for the parties thereto to release and waive
any and all claims that any of them may have against the Company under the
Management Agreement as of the Closing; provided that such termination and
release shall be effected in a manner so that all indemnification obligations
of the Company thereunder shall survive such termination and release.

6.14 Resignation of Managers. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer evidence of the resignation, effective as of the Closing, of all
managers and officers of the Company (other than employees of the Company and
those designated by Buyer to the Company not later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date).

6.15 Representation and Warranty Insurance. Buyer shall cause the RandW
Insurance to explicitly provide that the provider of the RandW Insurance will
not have the right to, and will not, pursue any subrogation or contribution
rights or any other claims against Seller in connection with any claim made by
Buyer thereunder. 6.16 SAR Plan. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall assign, and Seller
shall assume, the Company's Share Appreciation Rights Plan (the "SAR Plan")
effective as of no later than immediately prior to the Closing. The awards
under the SAR Plan shall be paid in a manner compliant with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A). If and when any amounts become
payable under the SAR Plan, Seller shall either (a) pay such amounts to the
Company or (b) direct Buyer (or the Escrow Agent but solely to the extent such
amount would otherwise be disbursed to Seller pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement) to withhold from the amounts otherwise payable to Seller hereunder
the amounts due under the SAR Plan, in which case Buyer, or the Escrow Agent,
as applicable, shall promptly pay such amounts to the Company. Buyer shall
cause the Company to in turn pay such amounts, less applicable withholdings,
to the participants in the SAR Plan as soon as reasonably practicable after

survival period for the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein is herein referred to as the "Survival Expiration Date". No
claim for indemnification relating to the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement may be asserted pursuant

the applicable Survival Expiration Date and (b) such claim is made in respect
of Damages incurred prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date or, to
the extent arising out of a claim by a third party (including any claim by any
Governmental Authority) (a "Third Party Claim") and (x) an Action is commenced
or such claim is asserted by such third party in writing prior to the
applicable Survival Expiration Date, and (y) such claim is made in respect of
Damages reasonably expected to arise in connection with such Third Party
Claim.

9.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to this Article IX, Buyer and its officers, directors, partners,
employees, agents and Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties") shall be entitled to indemnification solely from the Indemnity
Escrow Funds (to the extent the Indemnity Escrow Funds are available) for any
and all Damages to the extent attributable to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty the Company or Seller has made in this Agreement or
in the certificates required to be delivered by the Company and the Seller
pursuant to Section 7.2(c) or (ii) any breach, violation or default by the
Company or the Seller of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company
or the Seller in this Agreement (collectively, the claims made under clauses
(i) and (ii), "Buyer Claims").

(b) Subject to this Article IX, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and its
officers, directors, managers, partners, employees, agents and Affiliates (the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless for any and all Damages to the extent
attributable to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty Buyer has
made in this Agreement in the certificate required to be delivered by Buyer
pursuant to Section 7.2(c) or (ii) any breach, violation or default by Buyer
of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement
(collectively, the claims made under clauses (i) and (ii), "Seller Claims").

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach and the amount of any Damages that
are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification or reimbursement
hereunder, each representation and warranty in this Agreement and the
schedules and exhibits hereto shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to any Materiality Qualifier contained in such representation or
warranty which has the effect of making such representation and warranty less
likely to be breached (as if such word or words were deleted from such
representation or warranty). As used in this paragraph (c), "Materiality Qualifier" means any reference or qualification to a set of facts
using the term "material," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar phrase.

9.3 Indemnification Claim Procedures.

(a) With respect to Third Party Claims, if any Action is commenced or a Third
Party Claim is asserted in writing, in each case that may give rise to a claim
for indemnification (an "Indemnification Claim") by any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (each, an "Indemnified Party"), then such
Indemnified Party will promptly give written notice to the Indemnitor of such
matter. Such notice shall include all relevant information respecting such
Third Party Claim that is in the possession of the Indemnified Party
(including without limitation copies of any complaint or other process with
respect to an Action commenced by a third party or if an Action has not been
commenced, a copy of the writing of such third party asserting such Third
Party Claim), a reasonable estimate of the amount of such Indemnification
Claim, the method of computation of such estimate and a specific reference to
the provision of this Agreement upon which such Indemnification Claim is
based. Failure to notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the
defense of such Action is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's
failure to give such notice. An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of any Action subject to any such
Indemnification Claim with counsel of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or
compromise any such Action, and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all
respects with the conduct of such defense by the Indemnitor and/or the
settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the
Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the
Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement is solely for
monetary compensation and provides for a complete release of the claims that
are the subject of such Action in favor of the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and
the Indemnitor does not, within thirty (30) days after such notice is given,
give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of
the Action or Actions subject to such Indemnification Claim and thereafter
promptly assume such defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the
defense of such Action; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party will not
agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise
with respect to the Action or Actions subject to any such Indemnification
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). To the extent the defense of any
Action subject to any Indemnification Claim is assumed by Seller as the
Indemnitor, at the election of the Indemnitor, the costs and expenses of such
defense of such, and any payment in respect of, any settlement of such Action
shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, and Buyer and Seller shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Funds as is reasonably requested in writing by Seller to pay such costs and
expenses or other amounts.

(b) An Indemnification Claim for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim
may be asserted by written notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought; provided, however, that any Indemnification Claim in respect of any
actual or alleged breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein must be asserted prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date. Such notice shall include all relevant information respecting
such Indemnification Claim that is in the possession of the Indemnified Party,
the amount of such Indemnification Claim (if known), the method of computation
of such amount and a specific reference to the provision of this Agreement
upon which such Indemnification Claim is based.

9.4 Limitations on Indemnification Liability. Any claims an Indemnified Party
makes under this Article IX will be limited as follows:

(a) Indemnification Cap. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary,
the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX will not exceed the
Indemnity Escrow Amount minus any amounts paid in respect of a Deficit Amount
that exceeds the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds pursuant to Section
2.5(d). The Indemnity Escrow Funds shall serve as the sole and exclusive
source of payment of any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)
with respect to breaches of covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit Buyer's recourse under the RandW Insurance.

(b) Claims Basket. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, (i)
the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX with respect to any claim for indemnification
unless the amount of Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties that
are the subject of such claim exceeds the Per Claim Basket and (ii) the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX to the extent the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by Buyer
Indemnified Parties for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX exceeds the Basket Amount, in
which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification for the amount of such Damages in excess of the Basket Amount.
Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, (i) the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX with respect to any claim for indemnification unless the amount of
Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties that are the subject of
such claim exceeds the Per Claim Basket and (ii) the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX
to the extent the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX exceeds the Basket Amount, in
which event the Seller Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification for the amount of such Damages in excess of the Basket Amount.
For purposes of this Section 9.4(b), only Damages incurred by either the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties that exceed such party's
applicable Per Claim Basket shall be included in the applicable Basket Amount.

(c) Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other Third-Party
Recoveries. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
all Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds, Tax benefits and other third-party recoveries (other than
with respect to indemnification payments) which any Indemnified Party receives
or obtains in respect of any Damages incurred by such Indemnified Party. In
the event any Indemnified Party is entitled to any insurance proceeds, Tax
benefits or any third-party recoveries in respect of any Damages for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such insurance proceeds, Tax
benefits or third-party recoveries, including, with respect to third-party
recoveries, bringing a claim for indemnification or initiating a legal,
arbitrational or other proceeding. In the event that any such insurance
proceeds, Tax benefits or other third-party recoveries are realized by an
Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any
indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such
insurance proceeds, Tax benefits other third-party recoveries relate,
appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties
of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification payment. Any Buyer
Claim under Section 9.2(a)(i) shall be made only against the RandW Insurance and
may not be made pursuant to Section 9.2(a) to the extent (i) such Buyer Claim
is for an amount in excess of the retention amount provided for in the RandW
Insurance policy and (ii) such retention amount has been satisfied.

(d) Assignment of Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this Article IX, at the election of the
Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its
claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

(e) Other Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be indemnified or reimbursed for
any (i) Damages arising or resulting from any change in Applicable Law, GAAP
or applicable Tax reporting requirements from and after the Closing Date, (ii)
Damages in respect of matters included in the calculation of Company Cash,
Company Debt, Seller Transaction Expenses, or Net Working Capital, in each
case as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.5, (iii) Damages arising out
of any breach of the representations or warranties contained in Article III to
the extent a corresponding specific reserve for such Damages has been
established on the Latest Balance Sheet, or (iv) Damages to the extent that
such Damages are attributable to any voluntary act, omission, transaction, or
arrangement carried out at the request of, or with the written consent of,
Buyer or one of its Affiliates (the "Buyer Group") before, on or after the
Closing Date under the terms of this Agreement. If Seller is conducting any
defense against a Third Party Claim for which a Buyer Indemnified Party has
sought indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a), the fees and expenses
incurred by Seller in connection therewith, including legal costs and
expenses, shall be included in Damages for purposes of determining the amount
subject to the cap pursuant to Section 9.4(a).

9.5 Mitigation of Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX. The Indemnitor shall have the
right, but not the obligation, and shall be afforded the opportunity by the
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably possible, to take all available
steps to minimize Damages for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification.

9.6 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Except in respect of Fraud and of any Objection
pursuant to Section 2.5 (which Objection shall be resolved solely in
accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.5),
following the Closing, the indemnification provisions contained in this
Article IX will constitute the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy of the for monetary damages with respect to any and all claims relating (directly or
indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The provisions of this Article IX will not however
restrict the right of any party to seek specific performance or other
equitable remedies in connection with any breach of any of the covenants
contained in this Agreement; and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit Buyer's recourse under the RandW Insurance.

9.7 Release of Indemnity Escrow Amount.

(a) The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, which shall specify that
the funds held therein (if any) shall be released to Seller twenty (20) months
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that if any claim by an Indemnified
Party pursuant to Article IX shall have been properly asserted by any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement on or prior to such date and
remain pending on such date (any such claim, a "Pending Claim"), (a) the
Indemnity Escrow Funds released to Seller shall be the amount of Indemnity
Escrow Funds then held by the Escrow Agent, minus the aggregate amount of such
Pending Claim and (b) any Indemnity Escrow Funds that remain in escrow
following such date in respect of any such Pending Claim shall be released to
Seller upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such Pending Claim.

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall from time to time submit joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute
the Indemnity Escrow Funds in accordance with this Section 9.7 and the Escrow
Agreement.

9.8 Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any payments made pursuant to this Article
IX shall be considered as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

ARTICLE X

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

10.1 Non-Solicitation, Non-Disclosure and Standstill.

(a) General. In consideration of the payment of the amounts pursuant to
Section 2.3(a)(i)(A) by the Buyer, and in order to induce Buyer to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Acquisition, Seller on behalf of itself
and each of its Affiliates (other than the Company) hereby covenants and
agrees as follows:

(i) Without the prior consent of the Buyer, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates may, for a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, directly
or indirectly, for itself or for any other Person, (i) call on or solicit
Newman Shufflebarger, Jeff Bracken, Thomas Harrison, Marie Morrell, Owen
Paepke, or Barry Sullivan for purposes of entering into employment, consulting
or other business arrangements with such Persons in any way related to the
Business, or (ii) hire any such Person; provided, however, this Section
10.1(a)(i) shall not (i) apply to any general solicitation for employment or
retained search to the extent not specifically targeting employees of the
Company or (ii) any solicitation or hiring of any employee of the Company
whose services terminated for any reason at least six (6) months prior to the time of such
solicitation or hiring. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Section 10.1(a)(i) shall not apply to actions of portfolio
companies of American Securities LLC who which not acting at the direction of
American Securities LLC or with the actual knowledge of directors of such
portfolio company who are employees of American Securities LLC with respect to
matters prohibited by this subsection.

(ii) For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, the Seller shall and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and their employees and shall direct its
agents, accountants, legal counsel and other representatives and advisers
acting on its behalf in connection with its ownership of the Company Interests
to, hold in strict confidence, and not divulge or disclose any Confidential
Information; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation of confidence
shall not apply to (x) information that is required to be disclosed by Seller,
or Affiliates or any of its employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel or
other representatives or advisers as a result of any Action or legal process,
in which case the Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer of any such proposed
disclosure (if legally permitted), shall reasonably cooperate with the Buyer
(at the Buyer's expense) to obtain a protective order for such Confidential
Information and shall not disclose any more information than that which Seller
is advised by counsel is required to be disclosed pursuant to such Action or
legal process (provided that Seller may make such disclosure without
compliance with the notice and other obligations of this subsection (x) to the
extent required in connection with an inquiry or similar review by a
regulatory authority, self-regulatory authority, bank examiner or stock
exchange not targeting the Company) and (y) disclosures in connection with
Actions related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(iii) Seller agrees that the time limitation and scope of restrictions set
forth in this Subsection 10.1(a) are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of the Buyer and to protect the benefit of the
Buyer's bargain and the goodwill of the Seller. The Seller agrees that any
reduction to the time limitation or scope of restrictions set forth herein
would seriously undermine the efficacy of this Subsection 10.1(a) and the
protections that it is intended to provide. The Seller acknowledges and agrees
that the covenants contained in this Subsection 10.1(a) are essential elements
of this Agreement and that, but for these covenants the Buyer would not have
agreed to purchase the Company. The Seller further expressly agrees and
acknowledges that (a) the confidentiality and non-solicitation covenants
contained in this Subsection 10.1(a) (1) are reasonable and necessary for the
protection of the Buyer with respect to the covenants' respective stated
purposes, time and scope, and are supported by adequate consideration, (2) are
necessary for the protection of the Buyer's legitimate business interests,
including the trade secrets, goodwill and relationships with customers and
suppliers purchased by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and (3) are not
unduly restrictive of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates, (b) the
Seller and each of its Affiliates has sufficient business alternatives and
sufficient assets, taking into account the amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.3(a)(i)(A) by the Buyer and other consideration received and to be received,
directly or indirectly, by the Seller and such Affiliates, such that neither
Seller nor such Affiliates have to impermissibly use its Confidential
Information described in this Agreement in order to conduct its business, and
(c) in entering into and negotiating this Agreement and the terms hereof,
there has been no disparity in bargaining power between the parties and Seller
has been represented by counsel and fully understands the terms hereof. The
existence of any claim or cause of action against Buyer or its Affiliates by
Seller, or its Affiliates, whether predicated on Buyer's breach of this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense
to the enforcement by Buyer of the covenants contained in this Subsection
10.1(a). Seller acknowledges and agrees that a portion of the amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(i)(A) by the Buyer may be allocated as
consideration for the covenants set forth in this Subsection 10.1(a).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any covenant set forth in this Subsection
10.1(a) is breached by Seller or any its Affiliates, such allocation shall not
be deemed to be a measure of the damages that would result from such a breach,
and none of them shall argue or in any way assert in any Action that such
consideration is a measure of the damages resulting from such breach. If any
covenant or restriction contained in this Subsection 10.1(a), or any part
thereof, is hereafter construed or found to be invalid or unenforceable in
part or in whole, this shall not affect the remainder of the covenants or
restrictions, which shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid
or unenforceable portions, and any court having jurisdiction shall enforce
such invalid or unenforceable covenant or restriction to the maximum extent
possible under Applicable Law, including the maximum permissible time and
scope for such covenant or restriction.

(b) Standstill. Seller on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates hereby
agrees that for a period ending on the date which is two (2) years from the
Closing none of them nor any successor or assign of any of them (regardless of
whether such Person is an Affiliate on the date hereof) will (a) acquire,
offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or
otherwise, control of HEICO Corporation, (b) make, or in any way participate,
directly or indirectly, as advisor or otherwise, in any "solicitation" of
"proxies" or consents to vote (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of
the Security and Exchange Commission), or seek to advise or influence any
Person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of HEICO
Corporation, in opposition to any proposed actions of the Board of Directors
of HEICO Corporation or in opposition to any nominees for Directors of HEICO
Corporation which nominees have been nominated by HEICO Corporation, its
management or its Board of Directors, (c) seek or assist any other party in
seeking representation on the Board of Directors of HEICO Corporation through
the election to the Board of Directors of individuals(s) not nominated and
supported by HEICO Corporation, its management and Board of Directors, (d)
pursue or publicly announce an interest in pursuing an acquisition of control
of HEICO Corporation or an alteration of the composition of HEICO
Corporation's Board of Directors or (e) advise or otherwise act, alone or in
concert with others, directly or indirectly, to seek to control or influence
the management, Board of Directors or policies of HEICO Corporation; provided,
that the provisions of this Section 10.1(b) shall not apply to any matters
involving, relating to, or in connection with the purchase or sale of debt
securities or other indebtedness of HEICO Corporation.

(c) Injunction. It is recognized and hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto
that a breach or violation by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any or all of
the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 10.1 will cause
irreparable harm and damage to Buyer and its Affiliates for which monetary
damages alone would not be sufficient. As a result, Seller recognizes and
hereby acknowledges that Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction from any
court of competent jurisdiction enjoining and restraining any breach or
violation of, or threatened breach or violation of, any or all of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 10.1(a) and that such right
to injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other rights or
remedies Buyer may possess hereunder, at law, or in equity. Nothing contained
in this Section 10.1 shall be construed to prevent Buyer from seeking and recovering Damages sustained by it as a result of any
breach or violation of any of the covenants or agreements contained herein.

PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE
SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL
DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT
CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.
THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO
ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER

11.15 Release. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller, on behalf of itself,
and its successors and assigns, and the Company, on behalf of itself and its
successors and assigns, does hereby release and forever discharge the Company
(in the case of the Seller) and the Seller and its Affiliates (in the case of
the Company) of and from any and all claims, actions, causes of action,
demands, suits, covenants, agreements, representations, obligations, costs,
liabilities, expenses, losses and debts of any nature whatsoever, both at law
and in equity, relating to any matter, claim or right, whether presently known
or unknown, which they now have, ever had or may have against such released
parties arising from or relating to any facts or events regarding, relating
to, or concerning the Company or Business, occurring at or prior to the
Closing other than those related to their respective obligations under this 11.16 Specific Performance. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to this Agreement to perform its agreements and
covenants hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the other parties to this
Agreement for which monetary damages, even if available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
the granting of equitable relief (including specific performance and
injunctive relief) by any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such
party's obligations hereunder. The parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such equitable relief and that this Section 11.16 is without
prejudice to any other rights that the parties hereto may have for any failure
to perform this Agreement.

11.17 Conflicts and Privilege. Buyer hereby waives and agrees not to assert,
and agrees to cause each of its subsidiaries to waive and to not assert, any
conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after
the Closing, of Seller or any officer, employee, director or Affiliate of
Seller or the Company in any matter involving this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby (including any litigation,
arbitration, mediation or other proceeding), by Kaye Scholer LLP. Buyer and
the Company further agree that, as to all communications between Kaye Scholer
LLP, the Company and Seller that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney/client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may be controlled by
Seller, and shall not pass to or be claimed or controlled by the Company;
provided that Seller shall not waive such attorney/client privilege other than
to the extent appropriate in connection with the enforcement or defense of
their respective rights or obligations existing under this Agreement and the
other agreements referred to herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event a dispute arises between Buyer or the Company and a Person other than
Seller after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney/client privilege
to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Kaye Scholer LLP to
such Person.
