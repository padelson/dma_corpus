the liabilities of The Cronos Group, a limited liability company (soci&#233;t&#233; anonyme holding)
organized and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (&#147;<B>Dolphin</B>&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;sell and
transfer the interests in container assets formerly owned by Dolphin and its affiliates to FBT
Transportation Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#147;<B>FBT</B>&#148;), or an affiliate or
affiliates thereof (the transactions referred to in clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;above being hereinafter
referred to collectively as the &#147;<B>Transaction</B>&#148;), and (iii)&nbsp;manage container assets owned by CF
Leasing Limited (a Bermuda exempted company) and/or any of its affiliates (and their respective
successors and assigns) following consummation of the Transaction.

(the &#147;Common Shares&#148;) in connection with Purchaser&#146;s capitalization in connection with the
Transaction. It is presently anticipated that a third party investor or investors that are
accredited investors (&#147;<B>Third Party Investors</B>&#148;) will join in such acquisition of Common Shares with
FBT and the Management Parties. FBT, the Third Party Investors and the Management Parties are
sometimes referred to herein as the &#147;<B>Investor Parties</B>.&#148; The Third Party Investors that will make
equity investments in Purchaser in accordance with this Summary of Terms will be subject to the
prior approval by FBT, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Summary of Terms includes the basic proposed rights, preferences and obligations of the
Investor Parties, which are to be in embodied in the governance documents of Purchaser and other
agreements among the Investor Parties. In addition to the terms set forth in this Summary of
