a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of
the properties it owns or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are not

at the annual shareholders meeting held June 12, 2002, with the official
record of the meeting filed and published in accordance with Luxembourgs
Companies Law on or about September 4, 2002. Accordingly, unless the

nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. Except as set forth in

debentures, notes or other indebtedness or securities of the Company (or its
Subsidiaries)

exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which the Shareholders (or the equity owners of the Subsidiaries) may vote.
Except as set forth in this Section 4.2, there are no outstanding securities,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them is bound obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock or other equity or voting securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking. Other than the Companys obligation to redeem 200,000 SARs
issued by the Company in accordance with the terms of those SARs, there are
no outstanding contractual obligations, commitments, understandings or
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire or make any payment in respect of any shares of capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no irrevocable proxies with respect to shares of capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

     8.1  |   | Non-Solicitation  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | On and after the date of this Agreement, the

information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by
any other Person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing; _provided,

consultation with outside counsel and Raymond James, that such Acquisition
Proposal, if consummated in  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   ##### 

  

 

accordance with its terms, is likely to result in a Superior Proposal (and
such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by the Company or any of the
other Cronos Entities (or any of their respective officers,
employees, directors, investment bankers or other agents) and did not result
from any other breach of this Agreement), then the Company may, in response
to any such Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof, and subject to
providing prior written notice to the Sponsor in accordance with Section
8.1(c) of its decision to take such action and its compliance with the other
provisions of this Section 8.1, consider, participate in discussions, release
any Person from any standstill agreement, negotiate, cooperate,
furnish information (subject to Section 8.1(d)), assist and facilitate such
Acquisition Proposal. 

  

For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of assets
or a business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Cronos Entities, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of
any class of any equity securities of the Company, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
Cronos Entity whose assets or business constitutes 20% or more of the
net revenues, net income or assets of the Cronos Entities, taken as a whole),
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written offer from any Person (other
than Sponsor and its subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives) for a
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 50% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person beneficially owning 50% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (A) which provides for
consideration on a per share basis to the Shareholders with a value (taking
into account, among other things, the likelihood of such offer resulting in a
consummated transaction) exceeding the Purchase Price Per Share, (B) which,
considering all relevant factors, is more favorable to the Company and its
Shareholders than the Assets Sale and the Liquidation, and (C) for which the
third party has demonstrated that financing is 

    ##### 

  

  

       |   | reasonably likely to be obtained, in each case as
determined by the Board of Directors in its good faith judgment (based on the
advice of independent financial advisors and outside counsel). Any Superior
Proposal shall be an Acquisition Proposal.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (b)  |   | The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, any negotiations with any Person (other than the Fortis Parties)
with respect to any potential Acquisition Proposal existing or pending as of
the date of this Agreement. The Company agrees not to release any third party
from any confidentiality or standstill agreement except as permitted by
Section 8.1(a) and shall not waive the application of the Companys
Shareholder Rights Plan in favor of any third party except as
required pursuant to the Shareholder Rights Plan with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or final and non-appealable order of a court having
jurisdiction or an order of any applicable securities regulatory authority or
in connection with the determination that an Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal as permitted by subsection (a).  
      
  (c)  |   | The Company shall promptly provide notice to the Fortis
Parties of any Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments to any
Acquisition Proposal) or any inquiry that could lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or any amendments thereto or any request for information relating to
the Company or any other Cronos Entity in connection with such an Acquisition
Proposal or for access to the assets, books or records of the Company or any
other Cronos Entity by any Person or entity that informs the Company,
any member of the Board of Directors or such Cronos Entity that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the
Fortis Parties shall be made, from time to time, first orally and then
promptly in writing and shall indicate all material terms of the proposal
known to the Company (other than, as may be required by agreement, the
identity of the Person making such proposal). The Company shall keep the
Fortis Parties informed of the status, including any change to the material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Nothing contained in this
Section 8.1 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall be deemed to prohibit the
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
as contemplated by Item 14 of Schedule 14A or Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if the Board of Directors
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to
so disclose such position could constitute a violation of applicable Law.  
      
  (d)  |   | If the Company is permitted under Section 8.1(a) to provide
information to a Person in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
may provide such Person with access to information regarding the Company,
subject to the execution of a confidentiality and standstill agreement not
less restrictive to the recipient thereof in the aggregate than the

  (e)  |   | The Company agrees that it will not (A) withdraw or modify,
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Fortis
Parties, the approval, adoption or recommendation by its Board of Directors
or any of its committees of this Agreement, the Assets Sale or
the Liquidation, or resolve to do so, (B) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) withdraw from
the Assets Sale or the Liquidation, or (D) enter into any agreement, other
than a confidentiality and standstill agreement as expressly permitted by
subsection (d), with any Person providing for or to facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, any amendment to an
Acquisition Proposal) unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and Raymond James, that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; the Company may then only
do so in compliance with the remainder of this Section 8.1(e). The Company
shall provide the Purchaser and the Sponsor with an opportunity to amend this
Agreement and the Proxy Statement to provide for at least equivalent
financial terms to those included in any such Superior Proposal. In
particular, the Company agrees to promptly provide the Fortis Parties with
oral and written notice of any such Superior Proposal (and with a copy of any
proposed agreement (" _Proposed Agreement_ ") relating to such
Superior Proposal), and the Fortis Parties shall have five (5) business days
after their receipt of such notice (and such copy of any Proposed Agreement,
if applicable) to decide whether Purchaser would like to match the offer of
the Superior Proposal. The Board of Directors shall review any written offer
delivered by Purchaser and Sponsor to so amend the terms of this Agreement,
provided that it is delivered to the Company within five (5) business days of
delivery of the Superior Proposal to the Fortis Parties, to determine, acting
in good faith, whether Purchasers amended offer would be at least
as favorable to the Shareholders as the Superior Proposal. If the Board of
Directors so determines, the Company and the Fortis Parties shall enter into
an amended Agreement reflecting the amended terms of the Assets Sale and the
Liquidation, and this Agreement may not be terminated. If the Board of
Directors continues to believe, acting in good faith, that the Superior
Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal with respect to the amended
offer, or does not receive an amended offer within such five (5) business day
period, then the Company may terminate this Agreement solely in order
to concurrently enter into any Proposed Agreement that contains such Superior
Proposal (and take such other actions described in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of
this Section 8.1(e)), subject to compliance with Section 8.2. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that each successive material modification of any
Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for

    | (f)  |   | The Company shall ensure that the officers, directors
and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any investment banker
or other advisor or representative retained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are aware of the provisions of this Section 8.1, and the Company
shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 8.1 by such officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, advisors or representatives.

       | (a)  |   | If:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Fortis Parties pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (provided such termination is not caused by, or does not result from, the Fortis Parties breach of this Agreement); or 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Fortis Parties pursuant to Section 7.1(e); or 

   

 (iii) an Acquisition Proposal or any amendment thereto or variation thereof is publicly announced prior to the date of the First Shareholders Meeting, and within nine (9) months after the date of termination of this Agreement any Person enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any of the following: (i) direct or indirect acquisition of the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries equal to 50.01% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 50.01% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable (other than pursuant to a bona fide securitization transaction) or, (ii) a direct or indirect acquisition of (A) 50.01% or more of the Companys interest in CF Leasing or (B) 50.01% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning 50.01% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, or (iv) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company; other than, in any such case, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or 

   

 (iv) this Agreement is terminated as a result of Purchaser failing to exercise its right to make an amended proposal pursuant to Section 8.1(e); or 

  

       | (b)  |   | If the Company enters into a Proposed Agreement
in accordance with Section 8.1(e);  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   ##### 

  

   

Then, in the event of a termination referred to in Section 8.2(a)(i), the
Company shall reimburse the Fortis Parties for their reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, including fees of
counsel, accountants, and financial advisors, to a maximum of $1,500,000, and
(ii) in the event of the other events referred to in subsection (a), and
immediately prior to the event referred to in subsection (b), the Company
shall pay to the Sponsor, by way of wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the sum of $5,950,000, to be reduced by any expenses previously
reimbursed (the " _Termination Fee_ "). The Company shall not be obligated to
make more than one payment of a Termination Fee under this Section 8.2 if one
or more of the events specified herein occurs. This Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. 

  

       | (c)  |   | The Parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Fortis
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Payment of the Termination Fee
described in this Section 8.2 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the
event of an intentional or willful breach of this Agreement but is otherwise
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Fortis Parties in connection with any
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1. If the Company
fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such
payment, Sponsor commences a suit to collect the Termination Fee, then and in
such event the prevailing Party in any such action shall be entitled to
recovery of its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) from the other Party incurred in
connection with the prosecution or defense of any such action.

GENERAL PROVISIONS  

  

     9.1  |   | Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | None of the representations or warranties in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date and all such representations and warranties will
be extinguished as of the close of business on the Closing Date. None of
Sponsor, Purchaser, or the Company, nor any officer, director, employee or
shareholder thereof shall be under any liability whatsoever with respect to
any such representation or warranty after the Closing Date. This Section 9.1
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Closing Date.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Each of the Parties is a sophisticated legal entity
that was advised by knowledgeable counsel and, to the extent it deemed
appropriate, other advisors in connection with this Agreement. Accordingly,
each of the  
   

   ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | Parties hereby acknowledges that (i) no Party has
relied upon or will rely upon any document or written or oral information
previously furnished or discovered by it or its representatives, other
than this Agreement, the Companys SEC Documents, the Public Limited
Partnerships SEC Documents, or the Disclosure Schedule, or any certificates
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) there are no representations
or warranties by or on behalf of any Party hereto or any of its respective
affiliates or representatives other than those expressly set forth in this
Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedule or in any certificates delivered
pursuant to this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | The representations and warranties made in this
Agreement by the Company will be deemed for all purposes to be qualified by
(i) the disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ that the
disclosure indicates the Section of this Agreement to which it relates, and
_provided further_ , that the disclosure with respect to any one Section of
this Agreement shall also be deemed to relate to any other Section of this
Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent from the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section(s),
or (ii) the disclosures made in the Companys SEC Documents or the Public
Limited Partnerships SEC Documents filed on or after December 31, 2005. The
inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule will not be deemed an
admission by the Company that such listed matter is material or that such
listed matter has or would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.  
   

  

     9.2  |   | Amendment  
---|---|--- 
   

   

This Agreement may not be amended except by written instrument signed by each
of the Parties. 

  

     9.3  |   | Further Assurances  
---|---|--- 
   

   

Subject to the conditions herein provided, each Party agrees to use its

contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the execution and delivery
of such documents as the other Party may reasonably require, and (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and
approvals referenced in this Agreement and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings, including, but not limited to, filings under
applicable Laws and submissions of information requested by Governmental
Entities. Each of the Parties shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with
the other Parties in taking such actions. 

   ##### 

  

  

     9.4  |   | Notification of Certain Matters; Fortis Parties  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Each Party shall give prompt notice to the others
of: (i) the occurrence or failure to occur of any event, which occurrence or
failure would cause or may cause any representation or warranty on its part
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement; and (ii) any failure of
such Party, or any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Any notice, instruction, waiver, or release required to
be given by the Company under this Agreement to the Fortis Parties shall be
deemed given to the Fortis Parties under this Agreement if given to Sponsor.
Any notice, instruction, waiver or release given by Sponsor to the Company
under this Agreement shall be deemed to be likewise given for and on behalf
of Purchaser, without the necessity by the Company of securing any
confirmation by Purchaser of any such notice, instruction, waiver, or
release.  
   

  

     9.5  |   | Access to Information  
---|---|--- 
   

   

The Company agrees to provide the Purchaser and the Sponsor and their
respective representatives with access during normal business hours to all
books, records, information and files in its possession and control and
access to its personnel on an as requested basis as well as access to its
properties and assets in order to allow them to conduct such investigations
as they may consider necessary or advisable for due diligence,
strategic planning and other valid business reasons, and further agrees to
assist them in all reasonable ways in any investigations which they may wish
to conduct. For the purposes of this Agreement, the words "made available",
as they relate to any information of the Company (or any other Cronos Entity,
as applicable), includes the inclusion of such information in the online data
room provided by the Company. Any investigation by the Purchaser or
the Sponsor and their respective representatives after the date of this
Agreement shall not mitigate, diminish or affect the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or any document or
certificate given pursuant hereto. 

  

     9.6  |   | Confidentiality  
---|---|--- 
   

   

Any information provided or made available by a Party to any other Party in
connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
information provided or made available pursuant to Section 9.5) shall not be
disclosed by the Party in receipt of any such information to any other Person
without the consent of the Party providing or making such information except
as required by Law. This Section 9.6 shall not apply to information which (i)
is or becomes generally 

   ##### 

  

   

available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Party to
whom the information was provided or made available, (ii) was within
the possession of a Party prior to it being provided or made available
hereunder, or (iii) becomes available to a Party from a source other than
another Party or any of its Representatives (as defined below) other than by
reason of a breach known to the Party of a confidentiality agreement by the
source with another Party. Notwithstanding this Section 9.6, information made
available or provided to a Party hereunder may be made available to
the directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives
of that Party (including, without limitation, its parent entities and their
attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors)
(collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") who need to know such information
to assist such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated herein,
provided that any such Representative will be advised of the provisions of
this Section 9.6, will be deemed to be bound hereby to the same extent as such
Party and such Party shall be liable for any breach hereof by any of its
Representatives. In the event a Party in receipt of another Partys
information is required to disclose such information by Law (other than
pursuant to routine examinations by applicable regulatory authorities),
it shall, to the extent practicable, provide such other Party with notice of
such requirement as far in advance of the intended disclosure as possible so
that the other Party may attempt to obtain a protective order. If the other
Party is not able to obtain such a protective order, the Party required to
disclose such information shall only disclose that portion of the information
it is legally required to disclose and will use its reasonable best efforts
to have any information it so discloses afforded confidential treatment. 

  

     9.7  |   | Directors and Officers Insurance; Indemnification  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Without limiting the right of the Company to do
so on its own prior to the Closing Date with the prior written consent of
Sponsor, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, Sponsor
hereby agrees to obtain and cause to be maintained directors and officers
liability insurance for the current and former directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those former directors and officers
listed on Schedule 9.7(a) of the Disclosure Schedule) on a six year
"trailing" (or "run-off") basis, subject to a maximum premium of 200% of the
annual premium currently being paid by the Company for directors and
officers liability insurance. If a run-off policy is not available at a
reasonable cost, then Purchaser agrees that for the period from the Closing
Date until six years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall maintain a
substantially equivalent directors and officers insurance policy with terms
and conditions no less advantageous to the directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries than those contained in the policy in effect on
the date hereof, for all present and former directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those former directors and officers
listed on Schedule 9.7(a) of the Disclosure Schedule), covering claims made
prior to or within six years after the Closing Date subject to a  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | maximum premium of 200% of the annual premium
currently being paid by the Company for directors and officers liability
insurance. It is agreed that a premium of 200% of the annual premium
currently being paid by the Company for directors and officers liability
insurance is a reasonable cost for a run-off policy, and the Company may
secure and pay for such a run-off policy without any further consent
of Sponsor. Purchaser also agrees that after the expiration of directors and
officers liability insurance for the directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, including any run-off policy, it will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such directors and officers to be covered
under Purchasers then existing directors and officers insurance policy, if
any.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | At all times following the Closing Date, Sponsor and
Purchaser, jointly and severally, shall indemnify all present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those
former directors and officers listed in Schedule 9.7(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule) (" _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, penalties, or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ")
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, and
arising out of or pertaining to (i) matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Closing Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Closing Date, and (ii) Purchasers assumption of the Company Liabilities, in
each instance of (i) and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, to the extent such Costs have not been paid for by insurance and
shall, in connection with defending any action for which indemnification is
available hereunder, reimburse such Indemnified Parties from time to time
upon demand upon receipt of sufficient supporting documentation for Costs
reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Parties; _provided_ that such
reimbursement shall be conditioned upon such Indemnified Parties agreement
to return such amounts to the Company or to Sponsor or Purchaser if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine that indemnification of
such Indemnified Parties is prohibited by applicable Law, and such
determination shall have become final and non-appealable. For purposes of
this paragraph, "applicable Law" shall mean Luxembourgs Companies Law.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The foregoing rights in Section 9.7(b) shall be in
addition to any rights against the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their
successors) to which any Indemnified Party may be entitled by reason of
the Charter Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, or
any contract with the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.  
      
    | (d)  |   | The provisions of this Section 9.7 are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be directly enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and representatives.  
   

    ##### 

 

   

     9.8  |   | Expenses  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The Purchaser shall pay all filing fees in connection with any
HSR Act filing and necessary approvals under competition and antitrust and
similar laws. The Company shall pay all filing, printing and mailing costs
related to the Proxy Statement. Except for the foregoing and as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section
2.2, each Party shall pay its own expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and/or
the termination of this Agreement, irrespective of the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

---|---|--- 
      
    |   | If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are

  9.11  |   | Entire Agreement, Assignment and Governing Law  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement,

undertakings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Other than as set forth in this Agreement, no
representation or warranty has been given by any Party to the others.

except that Sponsor and/or Purchaser may assign all or any portion of its, or
their, respective rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
affiliate upon three (3) business days prior written notice to the Company
and provided such affiliate executes and delivers a counterpart of
this Agreement pursuant to which it agrees to be bound by the terms of this  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | Agreement as Sponsor or Purchaser, as applicable,
but no such assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of liability for its
obligations hereunder; and (iii) except as contemplated by the last sentence
of Section 9.7(b), shall be governed in all respects, including validity,
interpretation, and effect, exclusively by the Laws of the State of New York,

       | (a)  |   | Subject to the provisions of Section 9.13, any
legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any matters
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, and any action for
enforcement of a judgment in respect thereof, shall be brought exclusively in
the state courts of New York or in the Federal District Court for the
Southern District of New York and, by the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, each Party hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and appellate courts thereof in respect of any action or proceeding.
Each of the Fortis Parties and the Company irrevocably consent to the service
of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, by a recognized express carrier or delivery service, to the
Fortis Parties or the Company, at their respective addresses referred to in
Section 9.9 hereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Each of the Fortis Parties and the Company each hereby
irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereinafter have to the
laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise brought in the courts
referred to above, and further irrevocably waives and agrees, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, not to plead or claim in any such court by way
of motion as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, (ii) that
it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in any such courts, (iii) that the
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (iv) that
the venue of such proceeding is improper, or (v) that this Agreement or the

---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The provisions of this Section 9.13 shall apply solely to any
dispute arising under Section 9.7, and shall be the exclusive mechanism for
resolving any dispute thereunder with respect to any officer or director
eligible to invoke the provisions

of Section 9.7 and who, with his or her initial claim, or, if not included
with his or her initial claim, within ten (10) days after notice given by the
Fortis Party after its receipt of an initial claim requesting such consent,
agrees in writing to follow and to be bound by the terms of this Section
9.13. 

  

       | (a)  |   | All disputes, claims, or controversies arising
after the Closing Date out of or relating to Section 9.7 that are not
resolved by agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively by binding
arbitration to be conducted before JAMS or its successor. The arbitration
shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration
Rules. The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California. For claims
of $500,000 or less, arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator,
and for claims in excess of $500,000, the arbitration shall be held before a
panel of three arbitrators. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS, as specifically modified
herein.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Sponsor, the Purchaser, and any applicable Third-Party
Beneficiary mutually covenant and agree that they shall make reasonable
efforts to hold arbitration hearings pursuant to this Section 9.13 within
sixty (60) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is
filed by any Party hereto. For purposes of this Section 9.13, Third Party
Beneficiaries (as defined in Section 9.14) shall be deemed Parties entitled
to initiate a proceeding hereunder. In connection with the arbitration
proceeding, the arbitrator(s) shall have the power to order the production of
documents by each Party and any third-party witness; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the arbitrator(s) shall not have the power to order the taking of
depositions, the answering of interrogatories, or the response to requests
for admission. In connection with any arbitration, each Party shall provide
to the other, no later than seven (7) business days before the date of the
arbitration, the identity of all persons, that may testify at the arbitration
and a copy of all documents that may be introduced at the arbitration or
considered to be used by a Partys witnesses or experts. The arbitrator(s)
shall not have the power to award damages in excess of actual compensatory
damages and shall not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or
any other damages that are specifically excluded under this Agreement,
and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Sponsor, Purchaser, the Company, and the claimant(s)
mutually covenant and agree that they will participate in arbitration
pursuant to this Section 9.13 in good faith. The arbitrator(s) may in his or
her discretion assess costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses of the prevailing Party) against any Party to a proceeding. Any
Party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrator(s)
shall be liable, in the arbitrators discretion, for costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees, incurred by the other Party in enforcing
the award. This Section 9.13 applies equally to requests for temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, except that in the case of
temporary or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | preliminary injunctive relief any Party may proceed in
court without prior arbitration for the limited purpose of avoiding immediate
and irreparable harm. The provisions of this Section 9.13 shall be
enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Judgment on the
arbitrators award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (d)  |   | Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to the jurisdiction of the state courts of
California and the Federal District Court for the Northern District of
California for the purposes of enforcing the arbitration provisions of this
Section 9.13. Each Party further irrevocably waives any objection to
proceeding before JAMS based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or to the
laying of venue and further irrevocably and conditionally waives and agrees
not to make any claim in any court that arbitration before JAMS has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties hereto hereby consents
to service of process by registered or certified mail at the address to which
notices are to be given. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that its
submission to jurisdiction and its consent to service of process by mail is
made for the express benefit of the other Parties hereto.

     9.14  |   | Third Party Beneficiaries  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The provisions of Section 9.7 are (i) intended for the benefit
of all present and former directors and officers (other than those former
directors and officers identified in Schedule 9.7(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by
each of such Persons and his or her heirs, executors, administrators
and other legal representatives (collectively, the " _Third Party
Beneficiaries_ ") and the Company and Purchaser shall hold the rights and
benefits of Section 9.7 in trust for and on behalf of the Third Party
Beneficiaries and each of the Company and Purchaser hereby accepts such trust
and agrees to hold the benefit of and enforce performance of such covenants
on behalf of the Third Party Beneficiaries, and (ii) are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that the Third Party Beneficiaries
may have by contract or otherwise.  
   

  

     9.15  |   | Waiver  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Any waiver of compliance with any obligation, covenant,
agreement, provision or condition of this Agreement or consent pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be effective unless evidenced by an instrument in
writing executed by the Party to be charged. Any waiver of compliance with
any such obligation, covenant, agreement, provision or condition of
this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other non-compliance.  
   

   ##### 

  

  

     9.16  |   | Time of Essence  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Each of the Parties hereto agrees that, with regard to all
dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of
the essence.  
      
  9.17  |   | Counterparts  
      
    |   | This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument, and it
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce more than
one counterpart.

ANNEX 1 

   

THE CRONOS GROUP 
 Societe Anonyme Holding 

   

PLAN OF LIQUIDATION AND DISSOLUTION 

   

 This Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (" _Plan_ ") is intended to accomplish the complete liquidation and dissolution of The Cronos Group, a societe anonyme holding organized and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the " _Company_ ") (Registrar Number RCS LUX B27.489), in accordance with the consolidated version of the law of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended to date (the " _Companies  Law_"), as follows: 

  

 1. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them by the Asset Purchase Agreement defined below. 

  

 2. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") has adopted this Plan and called three extraordinary meetings (the " _Meetings_ ") of the Companys shareholders (the " _Shareholders_ ") to take action on the Plan. The first Meeting (the " _First Meeting_ ") shall be called to consider and to vote upon (i) adoption of the Plan, (ii) approval of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2007 (the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ ") by and among the Company, FB Transportation Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Sponsor_ "), and CRX Acquisition Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company (" _Purchaser_ "); (iii) adoption of the Name Change; (iv) appointment of the Board of Directors (or members thereof) (or such other Person selected by the Company prior to the First Meeting and approved by the Fortis Parties) to serve as Liquidator to carry out the Assets Sale and the other duties of Liquidator under the Plan and the Companies Law; and (v) and such other matters as the Company deems appropriate to submit to the Shareholders at the First Meeting to implement the Plan. 

   

 (a) If at the First Meeting a quorum of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of the Company, par value $2.00 per share (the " _Common Shares_ ") is present, and Shareholders holding at least two-thirds of the Common Shares present either in person or by proxy vote for the adoption of this Plan, then the Plan shall constitute the adopted Plan of the Company as of the date of the First Meeting, or at such later date at which the Shareholders may approve the Plan if the First Meeting is adjourned, postponed, or continued to a later date (the " _Adoption Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that the Plan shall not be effective unless the Shareholders, at the First Meeting (or at any adjournment, postponement, or continuation thereof), take the following additional actions: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) Appoint the Liquidator, by vote of Shareholders holding a majority of Common Shares present either in person or by proxy; 

   

 (ii) Approve the Asset Purchase Agreement and Assets Sale by vote of Shareholders holding a majority of the Common Shares present either in person or by proxy; 

   

 (iii) Approve the Name Change, by vote of Shareholders holding at least two-thirds of the Common Shares present either in person or by proxy; and 

   

 (iv) Such other matters as the Board of Directors determines to be submitted to the Shareholders at the First Meeting to implement the Plan. 

 

If any resolution submitted to the Shareholders at the first Meeting is not
voted upon or approved, then, in the discretion of the Board of Directors,
such resolution(s) may be kept open for further consideration at a reconvened
or adjourned meeting. 

    

 (b) The second Meeting (" _Second Meeting_ ") shall be called for the same day as the First Meeting, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, to consider and vote upon (i) approval of the report of the Liquidator, which approval shall require the affirmative vote of Shareholders holding a majority of the Common Shares present either in person or by proxy; (ii) appointment of a Commissaire a la Liquidation (" _Liquidation Auditor_ ") to audit the report of the Liquidator pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Law, which approval shall require the affirmative vote of Shareholders holding a majority of the Common Shares present either in person or by proxy; and (iii) such other matters as the Board of Directors determines to be submitted to the Shareholders at the Second Meeting to implement the Plan. 

   

 (c) The third Meeting (" _Third Meeting_ ") shall be called for the same day as the Second Meeting, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, to consider and vote upon (i) approval of the report of the Liquidation Auditor, which approval shall require the affirmative vote of Shareholders holding a majority of the Common Shares present either in person or by proxy; and (ii) those additional steps determined by the Board of Directors to be submitted at the Third Meeting to close the Liquidation. 

  

 3. After the Adoption Date, the Company shall not engage in any business activities except to the extent necessary to wind-up its business and affairs and to distribute its assets in accordance with this Plan and the Companies Law. 

  

 4. (a) From and after the Adoption Date, the Company shall complete the following corporate actions: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) The Company shall sell its assets and assign its liabilities to Purchaser, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company shall deposit the proceeds paid to the Company in consideration of the sale by the Company of its assets to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Price_ ") to a disbursement account (the " _Disbursement Account_ ") established with the Companys transfer agent (in such capacity, the " _Paying Agent_ "). 

   

 (ii) The Liquidator, acting for and on behalf of the Company, shall cause the Paying Agent to distribute the Purchase Price, without interest, _pro rata_ to the Shareholders, said _pro rata_ distribution per Common Share referred to hereinafter as the " _Final Distribution_." The Final Distribution shall be made as soon as practicable after the closing of the sale by the Company of its assets to Purchaser under the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this paragraph 4 and the following paragraphs of this Plan, " _Shareholders_ " shall include: 

   

 (i) the holders of Stock Options identified on Schedule 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedule (" _Option Holders_ ") to the extent of that number of Common Shares issuable to the Option Holders at the Closing, determined on a "net issuance basis" in accordance with the following formula: 

  

N = _OS x (PS  E)_  

 

PS

     

 Where N equals the number of Common Shares issuable to the Option Holders on a net issuance basis; OS equals the number of Common Shares subject to the Stock Options; PS equals the Purchase Price Per Share; and E equals the exercise price of the Stock Option (where there is more than one exercise price, the formula shall be separately applied to each Stock Option with a separate exercise price to determine the total number of Common Shares issuable to the Option Holder on a "net issuance basis"); 

   

 (ii) The holders of SARs listed on Schedule 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedule (" _SAR Holders_ ") to the extent of that number of share units issuable to the SAR Holders at the Closing, determined on a "net issuance basis" in accordance with the following formula: 

  

N = _SARs x (PS  G)_  

 

PS

     

 Where N equals the number of share units issuable to the SAR Holder on a net issuance basis; SARs equals the number of share units subject to the SAR; PS equals the Purchase Price Per Share; and G equals the grant price of a share unit. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) The holders of Stock Units held by the directors identified on Schedule 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedule at the Closing to the extent of the number of Common Shares into which Stock Units are convertible. 

   

 (iv) The holders of Restricted Shares identified on Schedule 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent of the number of such Restricted Shares held by such holders at the Closing. 

  

 5. (a) From and after the Closing, all common shares of the Company held as treasury stock, and all Common Shares owned by any Subsidiary of the Company, shall be cancelled and retired and the holders thereof shall not participate in the Final Distribution. 

  

 (b) Each Common Share participating in the Liquidation shall evidence no economic rights, from and after the Closing, other than the right to receive the Final Distribution. Holders of Common Shares shall also have the right to vote at the Second and Third Meetings, as described in Paragraph 2(b) and (c) above. Upon approval of the matters to be presented at the Third Meeting, all such Common Shares shall cease to have any rights other than to participate in the Final Liquidation pursuant to Paragraph 6 hereof upon compliance with the procedures outlined in this Plan. 

   

 6. (a) Promptly after the Closing Date, the Liquidator shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that as of the close of business on the Closing Date represented outstanding Common Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), including to each Person identified in paragraph 4(b) hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Liquidator may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Final Distribution. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Final Distribution (subject to subsection (e), below) for each Common Share represented by such Certificate, to be mailed within five (5) business days of receipt of such Certificate and letter of transmittal, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Final Distribution is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment of the Final Distribution that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, together with any signature guaranty required by the Paying Agent, and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Final Distribution to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Common Shares pursuant to the Liquidation such amounts as the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld, (i) such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan as having been paid to the holder of Common Shares or Certificates, as applicable, in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made, and (ii) the Liquidator shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity, if any. 

   

 (c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by the Liquidator, the delivery of a bond (in such amount as the Liquidator may reasonably direct) as indemnity in accordance with the applicable Laws of Luxembourg against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, any Party or the Liquidator on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Liquidator shall cause the Paying Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Final Distribution deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with paragraph 4. 

   

 7. The implementation of this Plan shall be supervised by the Liquidator of the Company, who shall have all right, power, and authority to implement this Plan and to conduct the winding up and dissolution of the Company under Section VIII (Articles 141-151) of the Companies Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Liquidator may bring and defend any action on behalf of the Company, and transact or compromise any dispute involving the Company, subject, in each instance, to the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement. In discharging its responsibilities, the Liquidator may retain and employ the services of advisors, including, without limitation, counsel, accountants, paying agents, and shareholder search firms, upon such terms and for such compensation as the Liquidator determines. For its services as Liquidator of the Company, the Liquidator shall receive compensation and reimbursement of expenses as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or otherwise authorized by the Companies Law. The principal office of the Liquidator shall be 5, rue Guillaume Kroll, L-1882 Luxembourg, or such other location as the Liquidator determines. To the extent the Liquidator deems it advisable, the Liquidator, if more than one Person, may adopt such procedures as the Liquidator deems appropriate for the conduct of its meetings and the taking of action by it as Liquidator of the Company and, in the absence of the adoption of any such procedures, shall be subject to the procedures governing the conduct of meetings and the taking of actions applicable to the boards of directors of societe anonymes organized under the Companies Law. 

  

 8. The Liquidator is hereby authorized and directed to prepare a report or reports concerning the consummation of the Assets Sale and the adoption and implementation of this Plan as is necessary or appropriate under the Companies Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9. The Final Distribution to the Shareholders pursuant to Section 4 hereof shall be in complete redemption and cancellation of all outstanding Common Shares of the Company. The Company will close its stock transfer books and discontinue recording transfers of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Closing Date or as otherwise permitted by the Companies Law, and thereafter certificates representing the Companys Common Shares will not be assignable or transferable on the books of the Company, except by will, intestate succession, or operation of law. 

  

 10. If the Final Distribution to a Shareholder cannot be made, whether because the Shareholder cannot be located, has not surrendered his or her certificates evidencing the Common Shares, or for any other reason, the Final Distribution to which the Shareholder is entitled shall be transferred to the official of such state or other organization, if any, authorized by applicable law to receive the proceeds of such Final Distribution. The proceeds of such Final Distribution shall thereafter be held solely for the benefit of and for the ultimate distribution to such Shareholder, as the sole equitable owner thereof, and shall be treated as abandoned property in escheat to the applicable state or other jurisdiction in accordance with applicable Law. In no event shall the proceeds of any such distribution revert to or become the property of the Company. 

  

 11. After the Closing Date, the Liquidator shall prepare and file all reports and returns in order to perfect the liquidation and dissolution of the Company in accordance with the Companies Law. 

  

 12. The Company shall indemnify the Liquidator and its agents and representatives in accordance with the Companys Articles of Incorporation and its policies of indemnification (as adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on August 4, 1999, as amended June 1, 2001), for actions taken in connection with this Plan and the winding up of the business of the Company. The Liquidator, in its good faith discretion, is authorized to obtain and maintain insurance as may be necessary or appropriate to cover the Companys obligations hereunder. 

  

 13. Notwithstanding the authorization or consent to this Plan and the transactions contemplated hereby by the Shareholders, the Liquidator may modify or amend this Plan without further action by the Shareholders to the extent permitted by the Companies Law and, to the extent applicable, the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

  

 14. The Liquidator is hereby authorized, without further action by the Shareholders, to do and perform any and all acts, and to make, execute, deliver, or adopt any and all agreements, resolutions, conveyances, certificates, and other documents of every kind which are deemed necessary, appropriate, or desirable, in the good faith discretion of the Liquidator, to implement this Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, all filings or acts required by any law or regulation to wind up the Companys business.

 (a) Each Holder hereby agrees that, during any time prior to the complete Liquidation of the Company while this Agreement is in effect, at any meeting (whether an extraordinary general meeting or otherwise, and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting) of the Shareholders, however called, or in connection with any written consent of the Shareholders, Holder shall vote (or cause to be voted), in his, her or its capacity as a Shareholder, all Owned Shares: (i) in favor of the adoption of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, including, but not limited to any items to be considered and voted upon at any of the Shareholders Meetings; (ii) against any action or agreement that would (A) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Purchase Agreement or of the Holders under this Agreement or (B) impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, or adversely affect the Assets Sale, the Liquidation or the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement; and (iii) against the following actions (other than the Assets Sale, the Liquidation and the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement): (I) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, (II) any sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of the assets or business of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries; and (III) any other action which is intended or could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Assets Sale, the Liquidation or any of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement or the contemplated economic benefits of any of the foregoing; provided, that nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2 shall be deemed to limit any Holders right, upon instruction from the Purchaser, to vote for any adjournment or postponement of any meeting of the Shareholders. The Holders, in their capacity as Shareholders, shall not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person the effect of which would be inconsistent with or violative of the provisions and agreements contained in or referenced by this Section 2(a). 

   

 (b) Each Holder agrees to grant, at the request of the Purchaser or, as the case may be, the Company, upon the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, a proxy to vote the Owned Shares as indicated in subsection 2(a) above. Each Holder intends such proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest and will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by him, her or it with respect to the Owned Shares; _provided,_  

    ##### 

  

    

 _however_ , that such proxy shall terminate and be deemed revoked upon the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 3 hereof. 

   

 (c) Each Holders obligations hereunder are undertaken strictly in Holders capacity as a Shareholder, and no such obligation shall affect Holder or any of Holders affiliates in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company or as a fiduciary to any other person (other than any of the Shareholders), or shall be construed to require Holder to take, or in any way limit any action that Holder may take, to discharge Holders duties in such other capacity. 

   

 (d) Each Holder shall vote on all issues other than those specified in this Section 2 that may come before a meeting of the Shareholders in his, her or its sole discretion, provided that such vote does not contravene the provisions of this Section 2\. In the case of a Holder who is a member of the Companys Board of Directors, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to govern or relate to any actions, omissions to act, or votes taken or not taken by such Holder in his or her capacity as a director of the Company and no action taken by such Holder in his or her capacity as a director of the Company shall be deemed to violate any of such Holders duties under this Agreement. 

   

 (e) The Holders each further agree, until the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Purchase Agreement or the termination of the Purchase Agreement, to refrain from soliciting or, subject to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, negotiating or accepting any offer of merger, consolidation, or acquisition of any of the Company Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

   

 3. _Termination._ This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the approval of all matters to be presented at the Third Shareholders Meeting and (ii) the termination of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that the provisions of Section 8(c) hereof shall survive any such termination. 

  

 4. _Restrictions on Transfer; Other Proxies._ The Holders shall not, directly or indirectly; (i) Transfer to any Person any or all Owned Shares; (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any Owned Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to such Owned Shares; or (iii) take any action in their capacity as Shareholders that would make any representation or warranty of the Holders contained herein untrue or incorrect or would result in a breach by the Holders of their obligations under this Agreement or a breach by the Company of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement. Nothing in this Section 4 shall be deemed to limit rights of any persons other than the Holders. Each Holder further agrees to cause the Company not to register the Transfer of any certificate representing any of the Owned Shares unless such Transfer is made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 5. _Representations and Warranties of the Holders._ Each Holder hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows, solely with respect to himself, herself or itself: 

  

 (a) Holder has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform his, her or its respective obligations hereunder. If Holder is an individual, Holder has the legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement. If Holder is an 

    ##### 

  

    

entity, the execution and delivery by such Holder of this Agreement and the
performance by the Holder of its obligations hereunder have been duly and
validly authorized by the governing body of Holder and no other corporate or
other proceedings on the part of Holder are necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Holder and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Holder, enforceable against the Holder in accordance with its terms (subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)). 

   

 (c) Holder is the record and Beneficial Owner of all of the Owned Shares indicated opposite such Holders name on Schedule I hereto, which constitute all of the Owned Shares Beneficially Owned by such Holder as of the date hereof, and which are free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges, claims, security interests and other encumbrances. Other than as provided in this Agreement and under applicable securities laws, there are no restrictions on the voting rights or right of disposition, or any co-sale rights or rights of first refusal or similar rights, pertaining to such Owned Shares. 

   

 (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation by the Holder of the transactions contemplated hereby will conflict with or constitute a violation of or default under any contract, commitment, agreement, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which Holder is a party or by which Holder is bound. 

   

 6. _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser._ Purchaser hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the Holders as follows: 

  

 (a) Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Bermuda. Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and the performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Purchaser and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Purchaser are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Holders, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms (subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)). 

    ##### 

  

  

 (c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby will conflict with or constitute a violation of or default under any contract, commitment, agreement, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser is bound. 

   

 7\. _Further Assurances._ From time to time, at the other partys request and without further consideration, each party hereto shall execute and delivery such additional documents and take all such further lawful action as may be commercially reasonable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 8. _Miscellaneous._  

  

 (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties, and there are no warranties, representations or other agreements between the parties in connection with the subject matter hereof except as set forth specifically herein or contemplated hereby. Each party to this Agreement agrees that (i) no other party to this Agreement (including its agents and representatives) has made any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to or with such party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the agreements referenced herein, and (ii) such party has not relied upon any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, other than those referred to in clause (i) above. In this Agreement, unless the contrary intention appears, words importing the singular include the plural and vice versa. 

   

 (b) The Holders agree that this Agreement and the respective rights and obligations of the Holders hereunder shall attach to any Company Shares, any securities convertible into such shares, and any other securities of the Company entitled, or which may be entitled, to vote generally in the election of directors and any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such securities (whether or not subject to contingencies with respect to any matter or proposal submitted for the vote or consent of the Shareholders), that may become Beneficially Owned by such Holders. 

   

 (c) All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses. 

   

 (d) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of each other party to this Agreement; _provided_ , that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any subsidiary or affiliate of Purchaser, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

     ##### 

 

   

 (e) This Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented, or otherwise modified or terminated, except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided by such other party hereunder, but any such waiver shall be effective only if in writing executed by the waiving party. 

   

 (f) All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given by any provision of this Agreement shall be in writing or transmitted electronically and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt if received before 5:00 p.m. of a business day or, on the business day following receipt if received after 5:00 p.m. of a business day, addressed as follows:

 (h) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages.

    ##### 

  

    

instituted in any state or federal court sitting in New York or an applicable
court in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. 

   

 (i) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance. 

   

 (j) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New York (regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law) as to all matters, including maters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies; provided, however, that the internal laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shall apply with respect to matters governed thereby. 

   

 (k) The headings of the sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 Unless otherwise noted, all section references in this Agreement are references to the specified section of this Agreement.

Re: 

  |   | Dolphin, Inc.  [Name of Individual]  Equity Commitment Letter  
   

  

Gentlemen: 

   

 Reference is made to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among CRX Acquisition Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company (" _Purchaser_ "), FB Transportation Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Sponsor_ "), and The Cronos Group, a limited liability company ( _soci ete anonyme holding_) organized and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the " _Company_ "), pursuant to which Purchaser, or a permitted assignee of Purchaser, will acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of the Company subject to and in accordance with its terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

  

 The undersigned is entering into this commitment letter agreement (" _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") at or about the same time that certain other holders of Common Shares of the Company are entering into Equity Commitment Letters with Purchaser having terms substantially similar hereto. The undersigned, such other Persons who are parties to such other Equity Commitment Letters and any other Persons who become parties to Equity Commitment Letters with Purchaser after the date hereof, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Investors_ ". This letter is being delivered to Sponsor and Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of the Asset Purchase Agreement by Purchaser, Sponsor and the Company. 

  

 This letter confirms the commitment of the undersigned, subject to the conditions set forth herein, to contribute and deliver to Purchaser at or immediately prior to the Closing cash in the amount set forth on _Schedule A_ attached hereto (and which is made a part hereof) (the " _Committed Cash_ ") in exchange for that number of common shares of Purchaser, US$0.01 par value per common share (such common shares of Purchaser being referred to herein as the " _Subject Equity Securities_ ") set forth on _Schedule A_. The amounts and consideration referred to above and in _Schedule A_ are subject to upwards adjustment under certain circumstances as set forth below; _provided however,_ that the undersigned shall not, under any circumstances, be obligated to contribute to Purchaser an amount of cash in excess of the "Maximum" amount of Committed Cash set forth on _Schedule A_. The undersigneds obligation hereunder to contribute and deliver the Committed Cash to Purchaser is herein referred to as the " _Commitment_ "), and such obligation is subject in all respects to (a) the terms of this letter, (b) the satisfaction of the 

   ##### 

  

 

conditions precedent to Purchasers and Sponsors obligations to effect the
Closing, (c) the performance in full by the other Investors of their
obligations under their respective Equity Commitment Letters and (d) the
issuance to the undersigned of the Subject Equity Securities (all of which
will be deemed to occur immediately prior to the Closing). The other terms and
conditions regarding the undersigneds proposed investment in Purchaser are
summarized in _Schedule B_, which is attached hereto and made a part
hereof. 

   

 The undersigneds obligation hereunder to contribute and deliver to Purchaser the Committed Cash will terminate automatically and immediately upon the earlier to occur of the following: (a) the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement and (b) the Closing. 

  

 The undersigned and Purchaser also each agree to enter into, effective upon the Closing, definitive agreements reflecting the terms and conditions set forth in this letter and those referred to or summarized in _Schedule B_ hereof, with such agreements, (a) in each case, containing such other terms as are (i) not materially inconsistent with the terms and conditions hereof and those summarized in _Schedule B_ and (ii) not materially adverse to the undersigned, Sponsor or Purchaser, and (b) including a definitive employment agreement containing terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in _Exhibit I_ which is attached hereto and made a part hereof. 

  

 Effective immediately prior to the Closing, the employment agreement(s) of the undersigned with the Company shall terminate, and undersigned shall have no rights or entitlements thereunder, provided that such termination is subject to the satisfaction of all of the following conditions: 

   

(a) The transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement are
consummated in accordance with the terms thereof, including the undersigneds
exercise of any Stock Options, redemption of any SARs, settlement of any
Stock Units, and claiming of vested ownership of any Restricted Shares, as
the case may be, on an accelerated vesting basis as contemplated by Section
2.3 of the Asset Purchase Agreement; and 

   

(b) Simultaneously with the Closing, the undersigned and Purchaser shall have
entered into the agreements referred to in the first immediately preceding
full paragraph above. 

 

Should any of such conditions not be satisfied, the employment agreement(s) of
the undersigned referred to above shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms. 

   

 Nothing hereunder shall limit or restrict the undersigned from exercising any duties to the Company, its Board of Directors or its Shareholders to the extent the exercise of such duties is otherwise permitted under Section 8.1 of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

  

 The undersigneds rights and obligations under this Equity Commitment Letter may not be assigned without the prior written consent of Purchaser, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void and of no force or effect. Except to the extent otherwise agreed to by Purchaser, any such permitted assignment shall not relieve the undersigned of its obligations under this 

   ##### 

  

 

letter. This letter may not be amended, and no provision hereof waived or
modified, except by an instrument in writing signed by Purchaser and the
undersigned and approved in writing by Sponsor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the undersigned and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the
structure and terms of the proposed investment contemplated hereunder may be
subject to change upon and subject to the mutual consent of the parties
hereto. 

   

 Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to an entity affiliated with Purchaser, _provided_ that (i) such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and (ii) such assignment does not adversely affect in any material respect the undersigneds rights or benefits hereunder. 

  

 This Equity Commitment Letter shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the undersigned and Purchaser and their respective heirs, guardians, representatives, trustees, executors, successors and permitted assigns, and nothing set forth in this letter shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person other than the undersigned, Sponsor and Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any benefits, rights or remedies under or by reason of, or any rights to enforce the Commitment or any other provisions of this letter. 

  

 The undersigned represents and warrants to Purchaser that: (i) the undersigned has the requisite capacity and authority to execute and deliver this letter and to fulfill and perform the undersigneds obligations hereunder; (ii) this letter has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the undersigned and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the undersigned enforceable by Purchaser against the undersigned in accordance with its terms; (iii) the undersigned has full and unrestricted power and authority to enter into and perform his or its obligations under this letter agreement without the consent or approval of, or any other action on the part of, any other Person; (iv) other than the filing by the undersigned of any reports with the SEC, neither the execution and delivery of this letter by the undersigned, nor the consummation by the undersigned of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the compliance by the undersigned with any of the provisions hereof (1) requires any consent or other permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or any other Person by the undersigned, (2) results in a violation or breach of, or constitutes (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or gives rise to any third party right of termination, cancellation, material modification or acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement, document or instrument to which the undersigned is a party or by which the undersigned may be bound or affected, (3) violates any law or order or judgment of any governmental authority applicable to the undersigned, or (4) results in a lien or encumbrance upon any of the property of the undersigned; and (v) the undersigned has not entered into any actual or planned disposition of Common Shares, commitment or other agreement or arrangement that is inconsistent with the terms of this letter.

SUMMARY OF TERMS 
 FOR COMMON STOCK FINANCING OF 
 CRX ACQUISITION LTD.  

  

FEBRUARY 28, 2007  

  

 This Summary of Terms summarizes the principal terms of the proposed equity financing of a Bermuda exempted company ("Purchaser") in connection with its formation and its subsequent capitalization. It is intended that Purchaser will (i) acquire all of the assets and assume all of the liabilities of The Cronos Group, a limited liability company (societe anonyme holding) organized and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ("Dolphin"), (ii) sell and transfer the interests in container assets formerly owned by Dolphin and its affiliates to FBT Transportation Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("FBT"), or an affiliate or affiliates thereof (the transactions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Transaction"), and (iii) manage container assets owned by CF Leasing Limited (a Bermuda exempted company) and/or any of its affiliates (and their respective successors and assigns) following consummation of the Transaction. 

  

 It is intended that Dennis J. Tietz, Peter J. Younger, Frank P. Vaughan and John C. Kirby, current officers and/or directors of Dolphin (such individuals being referred herein to as the "Management Parties") will acquire, along with FBT, common shares, US $0.01 par value, of Purchaser (the "Common Shares") in connection with Purchasers capitalization in connection with the Transaction. It is presently anticipated that a third party investor or investors that are accredited investors ("Third Party Investors") will join in such acquisition of Common Shares with FBT and the Management Parties. FBT, the Third Party Investors and the Management Parties are sometimes referred to herein as the "Investor Parties." The Third Party Investors that will make equity investments in Purchaser in accordance with this Summary of Terms will be subject to the prior approval by FBT, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 This Summary of Terms includes the basic proposed rights, preferences and obligations of the Investor Parties, which are to be in embodied in the governance documents of Purchaser and other agreements among the Investor Parties. In addition to the terms set forth in this Summary of Terms, the Investor Parties intend to negotiate additional customary terms for inclusion in the governance documents and such other agreements. All sums in dollars contained herein shall refer to U.S. Dollars.

    ##### 

  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

_Drag Along:_

Common Shares of such other Investor Parties.

securities (collectively, "Equity Securities") (other than with respect to
a to-be-determined sum of Common Shares, including those issuable upon
exercise of options, which may be issued to employees and directors
of Purchaser under an equity incentive compensation plan to be approved by

money (including, for this purpose, capital lease obligations) that at any

  |   |   
  

_Liquidation Event:_  

  |   | Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to explore
a Liquidation Event by the end of the fifth year following the date of
the Shareholders Agreement. It is anticipated that such Liquidation Event
will result in aggregate net proceeds of at least $30.0 million, and
a minimum consideration to the Investor Parties attributed to the Common
Shares of $2.50 per share (such price being subject to usual and
customary adjustments for stock splits, reverse splits, stock dividends and
similar recapitalization events).  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | " _Liquidation Event"_ means any transaction or series of
related transactions constituting: (i) a voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding up
of Purchaser, (ii) a direct  
   

    ##### 

  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

  

  |   | or indirect, transfer, in one or a series of transactions, of
all or substantially all of the assets of Purchaser, (iii) a sale,
amalgamation, merger, reclassification, recapitalization,
restructuring, consolidation or business combination or any other
similar transaction of or involving Purchaser, unless the holders of record
of Purchasers voting stock as constituted immediately prior to the
consummation of any such transaction will, immediately after any
such transaction hold greater than 50% of the voting stock of the acquiring
entity or surviving entity, or either of such entities parent,
in approximately the same relative percentages after any such transaction
as before any such transaction, or (iv) the consummation of any
transaction by which any person or group (as referred to in Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than FBT, the Third Party Investors or
any of their respective permitted transferees, is or becomes the "beneficial
owner" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act), directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the voting stock
of Purchaser.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Until the fifth anniversary of the date of the
Shareholders Agreement, the approval of a Liquidation Event described
in clauses (ii) or (iii) above in the immediately preceding paragraph shall
also require the affirmative vote of Shareholders holding at least 65% of
the outstanding shares of Common Shares. On and after the fifth anniversary
of the date of the Shareholders Agreement, the approval of a Liquidation
Event described in such clauses (ii) or (iii) shall require only
the affirmative vote of Shareholders holding not less than the minimum
statutorily required percentage of shares outstanding in order for such
proposal to be approved. The Purchasers charter shall contain
these provisions.  
  



  |   |   
  

_Purchase or Repurchase of Investor Parties  Shares:_ 

  |   | For the first five (5) years following the execution and delivery
of the Shareholders Agreement, the Purchaser and the Shareholders will be
subject to usual and customary share purchase and repurchase arrangement
provisions to be determined by mutual agreement by and among the Purchaser
and the Investor Parties (including the Management Parties), including
rights of first refusal and rights to purchase and repurchase Common
Shares upon the occurrence of certain events affecting an Investor Party,
such as death, disability, divorce, foreclosure, retirement, insolvency,
voluntary or involuntary transfer or sale and termination of employment of
an Investor Party. Following such five (5) year period, it is currently
intended that the Shareholders shall not be subject to such purchase
or repurchase arrangements by or on behalf of the Purchaser and such other
Investor Parties.  
   

    ##### 

  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

_Termination:_  

  |   | All rights under the Shareholders Agreement shall terminate upon
a Liquidation Event.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | _OTHER AGREEMENTS_   
  



  |   |   
  

_Registration Rights Agreement:_  

  |   | The parties shall enter into a registration rights agreement that
shall provide for three demand registrations by any person holding at least
15% of the registrable securities at any time following the earlier of (a)
three (3) years after the date of the Closing and (b) six months following
an initial public offering. In addition, the parties shall have piggyback
registration rights and the agreement shall contain such other usual and
customary provisions as the parties may agree.  
  



  |   |   
  

_Employment Agreements:_  

  |   | Messrs. Tietz and Younger will each enter into an
employment agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
to FBT. Messrs. Tietzs and Youngers employment agreements shall each have
terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in
the proposed draft employment agreement attached to their respective equity
commitment letter as Exhibit I thereto. Messrs. Tietz and Younger will
each waive any severance payments they may be entitled to under their
existing employment arrangements. In addition, Mr. Younger will waive
any transaction bonus that he may be entitled to receive upon
the consummation of the Transaction. The terms and conditions of Messrs.
Vaughans and Kirbys current employment agreements with
certain Subsidiaries of Dolphin shall remain in full force and effect and
will not be affected by the Transaction.  
  



  |   |   
  

_Employee Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Etc.:_  

  |   | Subject to the provisions set forth above, the Board of Directors
of Purchaser shall implement such employee stock option, restricted shares
and such other equity compensation plans as it may determine.  
  



  |   |   
  

_Definitive Agreements; Governing Law:_  

  |   | This summary of terms does not constitute or create, and
shall not be deemed to constitute or create, any legally binding
or enforceable obligation, or any commitment to invest, on the part of any
party referred to in this summary of terms. No such obligation shall
be created except by the execution and delivery of definitive agreements
containing such terms and conditions of as shall be agreed upon by
the parties and then only in accordance with the terms and conditions of
such agreements. All such definitive agreements shall be governed in
all respects by the laws of the State of New York (except with respect to
certain terms that shall be governed by the internal law of
the jurisdiction of formation of Purchaser).
