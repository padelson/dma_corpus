necessary, except where failures to be so qualified and in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, prohibit, restrict or
delay, in any material respect, the performance by Buyer of Buyers
obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Buyer is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer Parent.

4.2 _Authority and Enforceability_. Buyer has all requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, its performance
hereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and,
assuming due execution and delivery by Seller, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its
terms and conditions, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, preference, moratorium
or other similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting
creditors generally or by general equity principles (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law) and
except that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms
of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion
of the court before which any Proceeding may be brought.

4.3 _Non-Contravention_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 4.4_ regarding
Consents, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer do not, and
Buyers performance hereunder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not (a) violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Buyer, (b) violate or constitute a breach of or
default under (with notice or lapse of time, or both), or permit termination,
modification or acceleration under, any Contract to which Buyer is party or by
which Buyers assets are bound, except where such violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, modifications and accelerations would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prohibit, restrict or delay, in any material
respect, the performance by Buyer of Buyers obligations under this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (c) violate
any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority applicable to Buyer, except
where such violations would not, individually or in the aggregate, prohibit,
restrict or delay, in any material respect, the  



 

-30-  performance by Buyer of Buyers obligations under this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.4 _Consents_. The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement, Buyers
performance hereunder, and the consummation of the transaction contemplated
hereby do not require (a) any Consent under any Contract to which Buyer is
party or by which Buyers assets are bound, except where failures to obtain
such Consents would not, individually or in the aggregate, prohibit, restrict
or delay, in any material respect, the performance by Buyer of Buyers
obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (b) any Governmental Approval, except (i) for
HSR Notifications and (ii) where failures to obtain such Governmental
Approval would not, individually or in the aggregate, prohibit, restrict or
delay, in any material respect, the performance by Buyer of Buyers
obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

4.5 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding, at law or in equity, pending
against or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened against or affecting Buyer,
nor is there any Order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator outstanding
against Buyer, in each case the adverse outcome of which would, individually
or in the aggregate, prohibit, restrict or delay, in any material respect,
the performance by Buyer of Buyers obligations under this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.6 _Brokers and Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker, intermediary,
finder or firm acting on behalf of Buyer is or will be entitled to
any brokers or finders fee or any other commission or similar fee, directly
or indirectly, from Buyer in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Buyers performance hereunder, or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.7 _Financial Capability_. Buyer currently has, and at all times prior to
Closing will have, sufficient immediately available U.S. funds to enable
Buyer to make payment of the Purchase Price, to permit Buyer to perform in a
timely manner all of its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyers ability to
consummate the Copley Midwest Share Purchase, the Copley Springfield Asset
Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
contingent upon its ability to obtain any financing whatsoever. 

4.8 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and excluding the effect of any inaccuracy of
the representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE III_ : (a) Buyer has
not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature or
become due and the then present fair salable value of the assets of
Buyer shall exceed the amount that will be required to pay its respective
probable liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent
liabilities) and its respective debts as they become absolute and matured, (b)
the assets of Buyer, at a fair valuation, shall exceed its respective debts
(including the probable amount of all contingent liabilities) and (c) Buyer
shall not have unreasonably small capital to carry on its business as
presently  



 

-31-  conducted or as proposed to be conducted. No transfer of property is being
made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud creditors of Seller or its Affiliates.

4.9 _Investment Intention_.

(a) Buyer is acquiring the Copley Ohio Common Shares and the Copley Peoria
Common Shares from Seller for investment for its own account and not with a
view to, or for the offer and sale in connection with, any distribution
thereof in violation of any applicable securities Law. Buyer has not, directly
or indirectly, offered any Copley Ohio Common Shares or Copley Peoria Common
Shares to any person, nor solicited any offer to buy any Copley Ohio Common
Shares or Copley Peoria Common Shares from any person, so as to bring the
offer and sale of any Copley Ohio Common Shares or Copley Peoria Common Shares
within the registration requirements of any applicable securities Law. Buyer
acknowledges that the Copley Ohio Common Shares and the Copley Peoria Common
Shares have not been registered for offer or sale under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or other applicable securities
Law (including state or foreign securities Law), and that the Copley Ohio
Common Shares and the Copley Peoria Common Shares may not be transferred, sold
or offered for sale, except pursuant to the registration provisions of the
Securities Act or other applicable securities Law, or pursuant to any
exemption therefrom.

(b) Buyer is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of the
Securities Act. Buyer and its representatives have undertaken an independent
investigation and verification of the business, operations and
financial condition of Seller, the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries and the Copley
Midwest Business. Buyer confirms that Seller and the Copley Midwest
Subsidiaries have provided it and its representatives the opportunity to ask
questions of the officers and management-level employees of Seller and the
Copley Midwest Subsidiaries and to acquire such additional information about
the business, operations and financial condition of Seller, the Copley Midwest
Subsidiaries and the Copley Midwest Business as requested by Buyer, and all
such information has been received.

4.10 _FCC Matters_. There are no facts relating to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (and all rules,
regulations and written policies thereunder) that would disqualify any of them
from obtaining control of the Copley Ohio Publications, the Copley Peoria
Publications or the Copley Springfield Publications or that would prohibit,
restrict or delay, in any material respect, the performance by Buyer of
Buyers obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, it is not
necessary for Buyer or any of its Affiliates to seek or obtain any waiver from
the Federal Communications Commission, dispose of any interest in any media or
communications property or interest, terminate any venture or arrangement, or
effectuate any change or restructuring of its ownership (including the removal
or withdrawal of directors or officers or the conversion or repurchase of
equity securities in Buyer or any of its Affiliates) to avoid any delay or
other limitation in the performance by Buyer of Buyers obligations under this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Springfield Business) and the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries as Buyer may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _that_ , Seller shall not be required to take
any action beyond Commercially Reasonable Efforts or that would unreasonably
disrupt its normal operations. The foregoing shall not require Seller to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in its reasonable
judgment is reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client
privilege, the disclosure of any protected Copley Midwest Intellectual
Property of any third party, or the violation of any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality. All requests for information made pursuant to
this  _Section 5.2_ shall be directed by Buyer to Dean Dwyer, Vice President
of Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Seller, or such other officer as may
be designated from time to time by Seller to receive such requests.

cause each of the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries to, carry on its business in
the Ordinary Course of Business and use all Commercially Reasonable Efforts to

_provided_ , _however_ , that no action by Seller or any Copley Midwest
Subsidiary with respect to matters specifically addressed by any provision of
_Section 5.3(b)_ or _5.3(c)_  shall be deemed a breach of this _Section
5.3(a)_ unless such action would constitute a breach of one or more of the
provisions of _Section 5.3(b)_ or _5.3(c)_.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller (with respect to
the Copley Springfield Business) shall not, and shall not permit any

3.18(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules), any employment agreement or any
retention agreement, in each case with respect to any Copley Midwest
Employee; or

(viii) make any change in any method of accounting for financial reporting,

concurrent change in or authoritative interpretation of GAAP.

Springfield Business, on the other, and all remaining guarantees issued by any
Copley Midwest Subsidiary in support of any indebtedness for borrowed money

omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing in accordance with, and as
limited by, the terms  



 

-36-  and conditions of the organizational documents of the applicable Copley
Midwest Subsidiary in effect as of the Effective Date and any applicable
insurance coverage. In the event that any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses is asserted or made within such six (6) year period,
all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses shall continue until
such claim is disposed of or all Orders of any Governmental Authorities in
connection with such claim are fully satisfied. The obligations of Buyer under
this _Section 5.9_ shall not in any way restrict or negate Sellers

against (A) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Copley Midwest
Subsidiaries and of Seller (with respect to the Copley Springfield Business)
for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion
through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (B) any and
all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary
group of which any Copley Midwest Subsidiary is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (C) any
and all Taxes of any person (other than the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries)
imposed on any Copley Midwest Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any Law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction (other than an event or transaction of Buyer or its
Affiliates) occurring before the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the case of clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, Seller shall be liable only to the
extent that such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any, reserved for such
Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) on the face of the Copley Midwest
Financial Statements, as such reserve is adjusted from time to time through
the Closing consistent with past practice of Seller and the Copley Midwest
Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns and as such reserve may be adjusted
in the final determination of Closing Working Capital pursuant to _Section
2.5_.

(ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from
and against all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) relating to the income
or activities of any Copley Midwest Subsidiary for all taxable periods that
are not Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

(iii) If a claim shall be made by any Tax Authority with respect to Taxes,
which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to a party pursuant
to this _Section 5.10_, the procedures set forth in _Section 10.3_ shall
apply.



 

-37- (b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any
Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on (i) in the
case of any Taxes measured by income or receipts, an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of
any other Taxes, the number of days in the applicable Tax Period up to and
including the Closing Date.

(c) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. With respect to the Copley Ohio Share
Purchase, Buyer and Seller shall timely make a joint election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and comparable provisions of state law with respect to

338(h)(10) Election_ "), and shall timely file executed copies of IRS
Form 8023, the required schedules thereto and any similar state forms, with
the proper authorities. Seller shall include any income, gain, loss or
deduction resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on its Tax Return to
the extent required by applicable Law and shall pay any Tax imposed on Seller
attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(d)  _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Seller shall include the income
of the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries on Sellers consolidated federal and state
Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal or
state Taxes attributable to such income. For all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries to
join in Sellers consolidated federal or state Tax Return and, in
jurisdictions requiring separate reporting, to file separate company state
and local Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed by
Seller in a manner consistent with past practice, except as required by a
change in applicable Law. Buyer shall cause the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries
to furnish information to Seller as reasonably requested by Seller to allow
Seller to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.10_. Buyer shall, and
shall cause it Affiliates to, consult and cooperate with Seller as to any
elections to be made on Tax Returns of any Copley Midwest Subsidiary for
periods ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _that_ , except as
required by applicable Law, Seller shall not cause any new or
different elections to be made if such elections would be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Copley Midwest Business, taken as a
whole. Buyer and Seller agree to report all transactions not in the Ordinary
Course of Business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyers purchase of
the stock of the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries on Buyers federal income Tax
Return to the extent permitted by Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). Buyer agrees
to indemnify Seller for any additional Tax owed by Seller (including Tax owed
by Seller due to this indemnification payment) resulting from any transaction
engaged in by the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries not in the Ordinary Course of
Business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyers purchase of the stock of
the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries. Buyer shall cause the Copley Midwest
Subsidiaries to file Tax Returns for all periods other than periods ending on
or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to any
Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide Seller with a reasonable opportunity to
review and consult with Buyer on any such Tax Returns and shall incorporate
such changes as Buyer, in its exercise of good faith, determines are
not unreasonable.



 

-38- (e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall, and Buyer
shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns with respect to the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries or the Copley Midwest

including any Tax Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the request of the other party) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Returns or audit, litigation or
other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided

to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters relating to the
Copley Midwest Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, Buyer or Seller shall, and Buyer
shall cause its Affiliates to, allow such party to take possession of such
books and records. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use, and
Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to use, their respective Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax
Authority or any other person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(f) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Copley
Midwest Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges

Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
afford to the other party hereto, and its counsel, accountants and other
authorized agents and representatives, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice and upon the execution and delivery of a confidentiality and

relating to Tax matters), reasonable access to the personnel, books, records
and other data relating to the Copley Springfield Acquired Assets, Copley
Springfield Assumed Liabilities, the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries and the
Copley Midwest Business and any New Buyer Employees in its and its Affiliates
possession or employment, and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom, to the extent that such access may be reasonably required by the
requesting party (i) to facilitate the investigation, litigation and final
disposition of any claims or audits which may have been or may be made
against any such party or its Affiliates, (ii) for the preparation of Tax
Returns and other documents and reports that such party or its Affiliates are
required to file with Governmental Authorities, (iii) for accounting purposes
(including for purposes of preparing closing financial statements, and closing
the books and records, of the Copley Midwest Business or the Copley Midwest
Subsidiaries) and (iv) for any other reasonable business purpose.
The foregoing shall not require any party to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in its reasonable judgment, upon the advice of
outside counsel, is reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-
client privilege. 

(b) No later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, close the books and records of the Copley
Midwest Business and the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date in

Contracts listed on _Section 3.18(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
Buyer shall comply (or, as appropriate, cause the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries
to comply) with the terms and conditions thereof, including with respect to
the providing of benefits. Each such employee shall be deemed to have accepted
such offer of employment or continued employment unless he or she
affirmatively declines such offer. Neither Seller nor its directors,

of Modified Duty (Return to Work) Programs for Injured Employees, including
providing modified duty assignments for injured employees until they have been

payment due and payable under any such employment agreement or retention
agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , if the New Buyer Employee who is party to

through December 31, 2007, then Buyer, and not Seller, shall be responsible
for, and covenants to pay or otherwise discharge, any such payment.

(collectively the " _New Plans_ ") that Buyer will offer, or will cause the
Copley Midwest Subsidiaries to offer, to the New Buyer Employees effective as
of the Closing Date in lieu of the Old Plans.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the New Plans, each New Buyer
Employee shall, subject  



 

-43-  to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited
with his or her years of service with Seller or its Affiliates, including
the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries, and any predecessor employer to the same
extent as such New Buyer Employee was entitled, immediately prior to the
Closing, to such credit for service under a comparable Old Plan; _provided_ ,
_that_ , the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a)
each New Buyer Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans if such New Buyer Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing in a comparable Old Plan, and
(b) for purposes of each New Plan providing health, medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any New Buyer Employee, Buyer shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such New Buyer Employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under a
comparable Old Plan, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such New Buyer Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such New Buyer Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payment,
co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(d) All eligible claims incurred by New Buyer Employees or their covered
dependents prior to the Closing under the Old Plans shall be covered by the
Old Plans, and all eligible claims incurred by New Buyer Employees or their
covered dependents on or after the Closing shall be covered by the New Plans.

Date, certain corporate and administrative services corresponding to services
provided by Seller to the Copley Midwest Business immediately prior to the
Closing (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "). Immediately following the
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make no changes to
(a) the base cash compensation level of any New Buyer Employee so long as

pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, or (b) the benefits of any New
Buyer Employee so long as such benefits for such New Buyer Employee are being
administered by Seller pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

6.4 _Severance Plan; Releases_. Following the Closing and for a period of no
less than one (1) year following the Closing, Buyer shall provide the New
Buyer Employees with severance benefits no less favorable than those provided
by Seller and the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Date. In addition, if Buyer or any Copley Midwest Subsidiary or any
of their respective Affiliates terminates any New Buyer Employee on  



 

-44-  or after the Closing and in connection with such termination obtains any
release from such New Buyer Employee, such release shall be executed as a
joint release in favor of Buyer and/or a Copley Midwest Subsidiary, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other, and Buyer shall forward a copy of each
such release to Seller promptly following its execution.

such pension plan with respect to services performed on and after the Closing.
Seller shall fully vest all New Buyer Employees in their benefits under any
such pension plan immediately prior to the Closing.

all New Buyer Employees in their benefits under the 401(k) plan of Seller (the
" _Old 401(k) Plan_ "). Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall cause a
401(k) plan maintained by Buyer (the " _New 401(k) Plan_ ") to accept a plan-
to-plan transfer of the accounts of the New Buyer Employees in the Old 401(k)
Plan. Buyer shall cause the New 401(k) Plan to be substantially identical to
the Old 401(k) Plan with respect to the amount and payment schedule of
matching contribution and profit sharing payments to be made by Buyer and
Copley Midwest Subsidiaries, as applicable. Seller shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to provide Buyer with such information as is reasonably

to-plan transfer shall be conducted pursuant to a wire transfer to the New
401(k) Plan, and shall include the transfer on the books of any participant
loans held within the transferred accounts.

6.8 _Flexible Spending Account Plans_. Effective as of the Closing, to
the extent that any New Buyer Employee has not used all deferred amounts in a

or dependent care assistance account plan and Seller shall cause all records
relating to such balances to be transferred to Buyer.

subject to the rights of any affected New Buyer Employees
regarding representation, (a) continue to recognize any labor organization
identified in _Section 3.18(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules as the

10.3_. The liability of an Indemnifying Party under this _Section 10.2_ or
under _Section 10.3_ with respect to Damages arising from claims of any third
party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this _Section
10.2_ or under _Section 10.3_ (" _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be governed by
and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions (except as
otherwise provided in  _Section 10.3(d)_ with respect to Tax Claims): if an
Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party
Claim within twenty (20) days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall
not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
_Section 10.2_ or under  _Section 10.3_, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of
its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if there exists a material conflict of interest (other than one that is
of a monetary nature) that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, at the  



 

-51-  expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties,
taken together (except to the extent that local counsel are necessary or
advisable for the conduct of such Proceeding, in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall also pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any such local
counsel). If the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party may
defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem
appropriate and may settle such claim or litigation on such terms as it may
deem appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that in settling any action in
respect of which indemnification is payable under this _ARTICLE X_ , it shall
act reasonably and in good faith and shall not so settle such action without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In the event the Indemnifying Party exercises the right
to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided
above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against
any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party,
all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying
Partys possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle
or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
which does not include an unconditional written release by the claimant or
plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim or (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the
settlement imposes equitable remedies or material obligations on the
Indemnified Party other than financial obligations for which such Indemnified
Party will be indemnified hereunder. No Third Party Claim which is being
defended in good faith by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement shall be settled or compromised by the Indemnified Party
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

(d) _Definition of Damages_. The term " _Damages_ " means any and all after-
Tax costs, losses, Taxes, liabilities, obligations, damages, lawsuits,
deficiencies, claims, demands and expenses (whether or not arising out of
Third Party Claims), including reasonable attorneys fees and all amounts paid
in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE
CONTRARY, NO PARTY HERETO SHALL BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY OR HOLD HARMLESS THE
OTHER PARTY HERETO OR OTHERWISE COMPENSATE ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY HERETO FOR
DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, OR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR SIMILAR DAMAGES.



 

-52- (e) Payment for indemnification obligations arising under this _Section 10.2_
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 10.4_.

10.3 _Tax Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, save and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against, without duplication: 

(i) any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from the breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller pursuant to  _Section 3.16_;
_provided_ , _that_ , Seller shall not have any obligation hereunder with
respect to any such breach unless the Buyer Indemnified Parties have made a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this  _Section 10.3_ with respect to
such breach prior to the expiration of such representation or warranty as set
forth in _Section 10.1_; and

(ii) any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from any breach by Seller
of any covenant contained in _Section 5.10_.

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, save and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, without duplication any and
all Damages arising out of or resulting from the breach by Buyer of any
covenant contained in _Section 5.10_.

(c) If a claim shall be made by any Tax Authority with respect to
Taxes, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to a party
pursuant to this _Section 10.3_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the notice provisions
set forth in _Section 10.2(c)_ shall apply.

(d) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall, upon written notification to
Buyer, control all Proceedings and may make all decisions relating to such
Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) at its own expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) to any
such decision that would have a material continuing effect on Buyer after the
Closing. Buyer and Seller shall jointly control all Proceedings relating to
any Tax Claim for a Straddle Period. With respect to any Tax Claim relating to
a Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer shall control all
Proceedings and may make all decisions relating to such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel) at its own expense. A party shall promptly notify the
other party if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax
Claim which it is entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement, and the
other party shall thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such Proceeding.

(e) Payment for indemnification obligations arising under this _Section 10.3_
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in  _Section 10.4_.

10.4 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement: 



 

-53- (a) no amount shall be payable by Seller pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_

pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ exceeds $3,500,000, and then only for the
amount by which such Damages exceed such threshold amount;

pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_ shall be an amount equal to $57,375,000;

(e) the amount of any Damages claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder
shall be net of any allowances and reserves provided in the Copley Midwest
Financial Statements that are specifically identified with respect thereto;

(f) the amount of any Damages claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party
hereunder shall be net of any insurance, indemnity, contribution or other

pursuant hereto, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall reimburse Seller for such
reduction in Damages for which such Buyer Indemnified Party was indemnified
prior to the realization of such reductions of Damages);

(g) an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement to
multiple recovery for the same Damages;

(h) in determining the amount of indemnification due under _Section 10.2_ or
_10.3_ , all payments shall be reduced by any Tax benefit actually and
currently realized by the Indemnified Party on account of the underlying
claim;

(i) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in the event that an Indemnifying Party can establish that an
Indemnified Party had actual Knowledge, on or before the Closing, of a breach
of a representation, warranty or covenant of the Indemnifying Party upon
which a claim for indemnification by the Indemnified Party is based, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any Damages resulting from or
arising out of such claim; and



 

-54- (j) if an Indemnified Party recovers Damages from an Indemnifying Party under
_Section 10.2_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of
such recovery, to the Indemnified Partys rights against any third party,
other than a third party with whom the Indemnified Party has a material
business agreement or arrangement, with respect to such recovered Damages,
subject to the subrogation rights of any insurer providing insurance coverage
under one of the Indemnified Partys policies and except to the extent that
the grant of subrogation rights to the Indemnifying Party is prohibited by
the terms of the applicable insurance policy.

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each party hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy relating to the Copley
Midwest Business, the Copley Midwest Share Purchase, the Copley Springfield
Asset Purchase, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
subject matter of this Agreement (other than claims for or in the nature of
fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this _ARTICLE
X_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other rights,
claims and causes of action it may have against the other party or its

respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents relating

Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement (other than claims for or
in the nature of fraud).

10.6 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it may claim indemnification under

Business, including the Copley Midwest Subsidiaries, after the Closing
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have contributed to or
aggravated any Damages as to which indemnification is available under this
_ARTICLE X_ , the court shall ascertain the amount, if any, by which such
operations have contributed to or aggravated any such Damages and may reduce
Sellers indemnification obligation by such amount.

ARTICLE XI 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1  _Further Assurances_.

(a) Each party hereto shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts, and shall
cause its Affiliates to use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts, to do and
perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and things

Buyers financial statements or in Buyers governmental reporting obligation,
in each case with respect to the acquisition of the Copley Midwest Business
for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (B) if the Closing is
consummated, provide a management representation letter to such auditor in
connection with such audit, to the extent the request for such letter is
reasonable and required for such audit and such letter contains commercially
reasonable representations, and (C) otherwise reasonably cooperate with Buyer
and such auditor in such audit and/or review and preparation of Buyers
financial statements, it being understood that for all purposes of (A), (B)

(including footnotes, corporate or other required allocations and/or required
disclosures) not already in Sellers possession or control, Buyer shall

party, in complying with the terms of this _Section 11.1_, shall be required

information that in its reasonable judgment is reasonably likely to result in
the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or to violate any of
its obligations to third parties with respect to confidentiality.

demands, consents and other communications required or permitted to be given

in accordance with the Laws of the State of California applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely therein.

them and that in addition to all other remedies available to them prior to

fullest extent permitted by law to an injunction restraining such breach,

provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall any such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver, unless otherwise expressly provided therein.
Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided in this
Agreement, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate
as a  



 

-59-  waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such
right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies of the parties hereto are cumulative and not alternative.

unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
provisions had never been contained herein, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.

11.14 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. The parties hereto
acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by the other
of its obligations hereunder as a material inducement to such partys
