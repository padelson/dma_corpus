the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of the Antitrust
Clearances.

    3.2.3  |   |

Should the Antitrust Clearances not have been obtained within 120 (one hundred
and twenty) days of the Execution Date (the " _Antitrust Term_ ") for
whatever reason, the Seller, without prejudice to any other right or remedy
it may have in the event of breach by the Purchaser of any of the provisions

withdraw from this Agreement by giving notice to the Purchaser by
registered letter, return receipt requested, within 20 (twenty) Business Days
after the expiry of the Antitrust Term. In such case, the provisions of

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Purchaser will not be liable towards the Seller, for any reason or cause,
should the Antitrust Clearances not be obtained due to its refusal to comply
with any condition, undertaking, obligation or requirement set forth by the
Antitrust Authorities if it has determined, pursuant to Section 3.2.2(iii),

Purchaser and the Purchasers group taken as a whole.

The Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing within 15 (fifteen) Business
Days after receipt of the relevant claim if it does not accept the existence
and/or amount or method of computation of the communicated Leakage. Failure
to deliver such objection will mean that the Seller shall have fully accepted
the Leakage.

    4.6  |   |

If the Purchaser receives an objection pursuant to Section 4.5 above, the
Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours for a period of 20 (twenty)

of, any Leakage notified by the Purchaser to the Seller within 120 (one
hundred and twenty) days from the Closing Date. No action or claim may be

      | 8.3.6  |   |

If the Seller pays to the Purchaser an amount in discharge of a Claim and any
of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Company (or respective successors in
interest) subsequently receives from a third party a sum which is referable
to the Claim (including without limitation by way of insurance or as Tax
refund or credit), the Purchaser shall immediately repay to the Seller: (i)
an amount equal to the sum so received from such third party by the
Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Company (or respective successors in
interest); or (ii) if the figure resulting under paragraph (i) above is
greater than the amount paid by the Seller in respect to the relevant
Claim, the amount paid by the Seller, provided that amounts to be paid back
to the Seller pursuant to this Section 8.3.6 shall be net of any tax paid or
payable by the Company and/or the Purchaser when receiving such sums.

      | 8.3.7  |   |

The Purchaser will not be entitled to indemnification (i) for Losses for
which the Company has made specific provisions or reserves accounted for in
the Financial Statements to the extent of such provisions or reserves or (ii)
in relation to Losses which were already indemnified or otherwise made good
in accordance with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any indemnity
or payment provided hereunder by the Seller shall be so applied as to avoid
any double counting.

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

      | 8.3.8  |   |

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Purchaser may
not assert any claim against the Seller for indemnification or otherwise to
the extent that such claim would arise from, or be increased as a result of,
any change in the applicable law or regulations or in the interpretation of
any existing law or regulations or the issuance of any new law or regulations
since the Execution Date.

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

      | 8.3.9  |   |

It is understood and agreed that if, in relation to the period in which
the relevant representations and warranties and obligations of the Seller are
valid and enforceable in accordance with this Agreement, there are enacted
provisions of law which would allow the Company to proceed with an amnesty or
an alternative dispute resolution procedure in the field of administrative or
environmental matters or exchange control, including amnesties for real
estate and building law violations, the following procedure shall apply. The
Seller shall have the right to take advantage of the intervening legislation
and, for that purpose, it will make, with the assistance of the Company,
the relevant calculations and applications. The Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company to, take all actions necessary or appropriate so that the
request of the Seller on such intervening legislation will be complied with
by the Company. The amount due under the intervening legislation for any
period prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by the Company, by drawing on
funds timely supplied by the Seller. Thereupon, the cap set forth in Section
8.3.3 above shall be reduced accordingly by such portion paid by the
Seller to the Company or the Purchaser and the relevant representations and
warranties shall have no further effect to the extent the subject matter
giving rise to the Claim and or the relevant breach of the relevant
representations and warranties has been settled by the amnesty or alternative
dispute resolution procedure.

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

The above procedure shall be applicable also in respect of amnesties or
other intervening legislation concerning Taxes and social security. However,
in this case the Company will take advantage of such intervening legislation
only with the Purchasers consent, it being however understood that, in case
the Purchaser does not provide its consent, the Sellers liability shall be
however limited to the amount that the Company would have paid if it had
taken advantage of such intervening legislation. 

  

      | 8.3.10  |   |

The Seller shall not be liable under this Section 8 or otherwise in respect of
any Loss, if and to the extent such Loss would not have arisen in the absence
of a voluntary act, fact or omission after the Closing Date by the Purchaser
or the Company, or any of their respective successors in interest, unless
such voluntary act, fact or omission is required to comply with any Law or
judgement.

or otherwise used in the negotiation or determination of the Purchase Price.

Purchasers Rights in respect of Losses

      | 8.4.1  |   |

Subject to Section 8.3 above the Purchasers right in respect of Losses shall
be subject to the following paragraphs of this Section 8.4.

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

      | 8.4.2  |   |

The Purchaser hereby undertakes to provide the Seller and the Bank with
written notice of any fact (including any third party claim or request, also
from public authorities) which may result in the Purchasers and/or the
Companys suffering a Loss for indemnification of which the Seller may be
held liable under this Agreement (the " _Notice of Claim_ "), setting forth
in reasonable detail (i) the claim which it intends to make (the " _Claim_
"), (ii) the alleged amount of the indemnification sought, (iii) the
representation, warranty or provision of this Agreement that the Purchaser
assumes to be breached and (iv) all available documentation which may
be necessary or appropriate for the purposes of enabling the Seller to be
informed and to take any and all appropriate actions in respect of the Loss
subject of the Claim. The Notice of Claim shall be dispatched promptly after
knowledge thereof and in all events under penalty of forfeiture by and not
later than 15 (fifteen) Business Days after such knowledge. In the event that
the deadline for filing an appeal, opposition or to take any other action in
respect of such Loss is less than 15 (fifteen) Business Days, the Notice of
Claim shall be given to the Seller hereunder by the Purchaser within
such shorter term as may be appropriate in the circumstances to allow the
filing of such an appeal, opposition or to take such action. For the purposes
of this provision, knowledge by the Purchaser shall mean the knowledge of the
President, Vice President of Strategy and Vice President of Finance of
Goodrich Actuation Systems Ltd. acting in the diligent performance of their
respective roles and responsibilities with respect to the operation of the
Company.

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

      | 8.4.3  |   |

The Seller shall respond to the Notice of Claim within 15 (fifteen) days
from receipt of the same. The Seller shall, subject to accepting liability
for the Claim, have the right, but not the obligation, to direct the
Companys actions in respect of the circumstances which gave rise or might
give rise to any Claim made by the Purchaser and in such event the Purchaser
undertakes to ensure, upon request by the Seller, that the Company shall: (a)
keep the Seller duly and promptly informed at all times of any notice,
communication or other information however received by the Company in
relation to the subject matter of such Claim; (b) cooperate with the Seller
in respect of the relevant remedies and actions by giving the Seller full
access to all records, files, data, and premises relating thereto and by
providing the necessary support from employees of the Company; and (c) timely
abide by any instructions of the Seller in the conduct of the legal
proceedings and/or settlement negotiations and/or other initiatives in
relation thereto. It is understood and agreed that if the Companys failure or
delay to comply with clauses (a), (b) or (c) above shall result in the Seller
suffering Losses or in an increase of the Loss incurred by the Company or the
Purchaser as a consequence of the Claim, the Loss to be indemnified by the
Seller shall be reduced by the Loss suffered by it and/or shall not take into
account the increase in the amount of the Loss caused by the Companys
failure or delay.

Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Purchaser (a) shall not, and shall
cause the Company not to, admit any liability, make acquiescence to, or
settle any third party claim which gave rise or which may give rise to a
Claim by the Purchaser, without the Sellers prior written consent, which
will not be unreasonably withheld, (b) shall take all reasonable actions,
before and after the Notice of Claim, including resisting the relevant
claims, which may be required to mitigate the amount of the Loss for
which indemnity is sought hereunder, (c) shall cause the Company to take all
such reasonable actions, before and after the Notice of Claim, including
resisting the relevant claims, which may be required to mitigate the amount
of the Loss for which indemnity is sought hereunder and (d) shall keep the
Seller at all times promptly and fully informed of any such initiatives or
actions under letter (b) and (c) above. It is understood and agreed that if
the Purchasers or the Companys failure or delay to comply with clauses
(a), (b), (c) or (d) above shall result in the Seller suffering Losses or in
an increase of the Loss incurred by the Company or the Purchaser as a
consequence of the Claim, the Loss to be indemnified by the Seller shall be
reduced by the Loss suffered by it and/or shall not take into account the
increase in the amount of the Loss caused by the Purchasers or the Companys
failure or delay.
