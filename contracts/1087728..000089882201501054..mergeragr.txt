3.1(l)(i)   -v-       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of December 27, 2001, by and
among Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), HJ Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and a newly formed, direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("SUB"), and HotJobs.com, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and
the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Offer
and the Merger (as defined herein).   WHEREAS, it is intended that the
acquisition be accomplished by Sub commencing an offer (as it may be amended
from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "OFFER") in which each
of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of the
Company (the "SHARES" or "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, may be exchanged for the right
to receive from Parent (A) a fraction of a share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Parent together with the associated rights to purchase
shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per
share, of Parent issued and issuable pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated
as of March 15, 2001 between Parent and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as
Rights Agent (together, "PARENT COMMON STOCK") as determined in accordance
with Article I hereof and (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration (together with
any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
paid pursuant to Article I hereof) in cash, to be followed by a merger of the
Company with and into Sub (the "FORWARD MERGER").   WHEREAS, subsequent to
the acquisition by Sub of Shares in the Offer, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each issued and outstanding
Share, other than Shares owned by Parent, Sub or the Company, will be
converted into the right to receive cash and Parent Common Stock as set forth
herein.   WHEREAS, the Company\'s Board of Directors has unanimously, by
those present at such meeting of the Board of Directors, determined that
the consideration to be paid for each Share in the Offer and the Merger is
fair to the holders of such Shares and has resolved to recommend that the
holders of each Share accept the Offer and adopt this Agreement and each of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein.   WHEREAS, the Company has validly
terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "TMP AGREEMENT"), dated as
of June 29, 2001, among TMP Worldwide Inc. ("TMP"), TMP Tower Corp. and the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f) thereof.     WHEREAS, the voting
agreement by and between John A. Hawkins and TMP dated as of June 29, 2001
was validly terminated on December 27, 2001 in accordance with Section 7.16
thereof.   WHEREAS, if the Tax Opinion (as defined herein) is not obtained,
the parties desire to provide for an alternate merger structure providing for
the merger of Sub (or other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion) with and into the
Company (the "REVERSE MERGER"), and the surviving corporation shall thereby
become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.   WHEREAS,
for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Offer and the
Forward Merger (the "TRANSACTION") shall be treated as an integrated
transaction and shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "CODE"), and that
this Agreement shall be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.   WHEREAS,
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent\'s and Sub\'s willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company (each, a "STOCKHOLDER")
are entering into a stockholders agreement in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 5.15, pursuant to which each such Stockholder is agreeing, among
other things, to validly tender for exchange all Shares owned by
such Stockholder.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE OFFER AND THE MERGER   Section 1.1 THE
OFFER.   (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof and none of the events set forth in
Annex I hereto shall have occurred or be existing, Sub (or another direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent in Parent\'s sole discretion (so
long as such change of entity shall not adversely affect the intended tax-
free nature of the transaction), in which case all references to "Sub" in
this Agreement shall be to such other Subsidiary) shall commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"EXCHANGE ACT")) not later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof
the Offer to exchange for each Share: (i) a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio and (ii) cash in an amount equal to
(A) Ten Dollars and Fifty Cents ($10.50) minus (B) an amount equal to the
product of (x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Market Price,
without interest (the "PER SHARE CASH CONSIDERATION") as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof (together, the "EXCHANGE
OFFER CONSIDERATION"). For purposes of this    2   Agreement, the
"EXCHANGE RATIO" shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing Five
Dollars and Twenty-Five Cents ($5.25) by the Parent Market Price; provided if
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable as part of the
Exchange Offer Consideration (assuming valid tender and no withdrawal of
Thirty-Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand (39,500,000) Shares) would
otherwise exceed Fifteen Million (15,000,000) (the "MAXIMUM NUMBER"),
then the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced to a number equal to the quotient of
(i) the Maximum Number divided by (ii) Thirty-Nine Million Five Hundred
Thousand (39,500,000), rounded to four decimal points. In the event that
Parent declares a stock split, stock dividend or other reclassification or
exchange with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record or ex-dividend
date occurring during the Valuation Period or for the period between the
termination of the Valuation Period and the Effective Time, there will be an
appropriate adjustment made to the closing sales prices during the Valuation
Period and the Maximum Number for purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio.
The "PARENT MARKET PRICE" means the average of the daily volume-weighted
average prices, rounded to four decimal points, of Parent Common Stock, as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P., during each Trading Day in the Valuation Period.
"VALUATION PERIOD" means the period of ten (10) consecutive Trading Days
ending on and including the second Trading Day before and excluding the
Initial Expiration Date or, if applicable, the latest extension of such
expiration date, other than an extension relating to a "subsequent offering
period" pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act.   (b) The obligations
of Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with the requirements of this Section 1.1(b)) shall be subject
only to (i) there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer that number of Shares which, together with the Shares
then owned by Parent or Sub (without giving effect to Shares subject to the
Stockholder Agreement (as defined herein) unless such shares have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn as of such time), represents at least a
majority of the Shares outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (the "MINIMUM
CONDITION"), and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. The
Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered to Parent pursuant to the Offer. As used in
this Agreement, "FULLY DILUTED BASIS" shall refer to the number of Shares
issued and outstanding at any time after taking into account all Shares
issuable upon the conversion of the Company\'s convertible securities or upon
the exercise of any options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of the
capital stock of the Company to the extent that the exercise price or
conversion price, as the case may be, of such convertible security, option,
warrant or right is less than $10.00 per share. Subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Sub of the Minimum Condition and the
other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto, Sub shall promptly consummate
the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all
Shares tendered and not withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer. The Offer shall be made by means of an
offer to purchase (the "OFFER TO PURCHASE") that contains the terms set forth
in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth
in Annex I hereto. Parent expressly reserves the right to waive any of such
conditions, to increase the Exchange Offer Consideration payable in the Offer
and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; provided, however,
that Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Sub not to, decrease the Exchange
Offer Consideration, change the form of consideration payable in the Offer
(including the ratio of cash to shares of Parent Common Stock, except as
provided in Section 1.1(a) hereof), decrease the number of Shares sought in
the Offer, waive the Minimum    3   Condition, impose additional
conditions to the Offer, extend the offer beyond the date that is twenty (20)
"business days" (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g) under the Exchange
Act) after commencement of the Offer (the "INITIAL EXPIRATION DATE") except
as set forth herein, or amend any other condition of the Offer in any manner
adverse to the holders of the Shares, in each case without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent to be authorized by the Company\'s Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sub may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer
beyond the Initial Expiration Date if, at the Initial Expiration Date or, if
applicable, the latest extension of such expiration date, any of the
conditions to Sub\'s obligation to accept Shares for payment shall not be
satisfied or waived, or (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by
any rule, regulation or interpretation of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or the staff thereof, or by any other federal,
state, local, foreign or other statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
any order, writ, decision, injunction, judgment, award or decree
(collectively, "LAW"), applicable to the Offer. If at the Initial Expiration
Date or the latest extension of such date all of the conditions to the Offer
have been satisfied or waived, Sub may (and, if the number of Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer equals seventy percent (70%)
or more, but less than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares outstanding on a
Fully Diluted Basis of Company Common Stock, shall) extend the Offer pursuant
to a "subsequent offering period" not to exceed twenty (20) business days (as
such term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g) under the Exchange Act) to the extent
permitted under, and in compliance with, Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act.   (c) Within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 (together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the "OFFER REGISTRATION STATEMENT") to register the offer and sale
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Registration
Statement will include a preliminary prospectus containing the information
required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the
"PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS"). As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is
commenced, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A
under the Exchange Act ("REGULATION M-A"), a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO which will contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the
Preliminary Prospectus, the Offer to Purchase and the related letter of
transmittal form and all other ancillary documents with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"SCHEDULE TO") (the Schedule TO, the Offer Registration Statement and such
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"OFFER DOCUMENTS"). Parent and Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. Parent
and Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Offer Documents before they are filed
with the SEC. In addition, Parent and Sub agree to provide the Company and
its counsel with any comments that Parent, Sub or their counsel may receive
from time to time from    4   the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any responses
thereto.   (d) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and Sub shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold,
from the Exchange Offer Consideration payable to a holder of Shares pursuant
to the Offer such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Sub or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Sub or
Parent, as the case may be.   Section 1.2 COMPANY ACTIONS.   (a) As soon
as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, the Company shall, in a
manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"SCHEDULE 14D-9") which shall, subject to the provisions of Section
4.2(b), contain the Recommendations (as defined herein). The Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by Law. The Company agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Sub and their
counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 and any amendment thereto before filing with the SEC. In addition, the
Company agrees to provide Parent, Sub and their counsel in writing with any
comments that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of such comments, and to consult with Parent, Sub and their counsel
prior to responding to any such comments.   (b) In connection with the
Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent
or Sub mailing labels, security position listings and all available listings
and computer files containing the names and addresses of the record and
beneficial holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall promptly
furnish Parent or Sub with such additional information and assistance
(including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the Shares, updated
periodically, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of
security positions) as Parent or Sub or its agent(s) may reasonably request
for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of the Shares.   (c) The Company hereby approves of and consents to
the Offer and the Merger and represents and warrants that the Company\'s
Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) unanimously,
by those present at such meeting of the Board of Directors, determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer    5   and the Merger, are advisable and are fair to and in the
best interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii) unanimously, by those
present at such meeting of the Board of Directors, approved and adopted this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, in a manner which constitutes a directors\' action (as defined in
Section 141(b) of the DGCL), (iii) unanimously, by those present at such
meeting of the Board of Directors, determined to terminate the TMP Agreement
in accordance with its terms pursuant to Section 7.1(f) thereof, and (iv)
unanimously, by those present at such meeting of the Board of Directors,
resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer,
tender their Shares to Parent thereunder and approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Merger (the recommendations referred to in this clause (iv) are
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "RECOMMENDATIONS"). The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Recommendations and approval of the Board of Directors described in the
immediately preceding sentence, and the Company shall not permit the
Recommendations and approval of the Company\'s Board of Directors or any
component thereof to be modified in any manner adverse to Parent or Sub or to
be withdrawn by the Company\'s Board of Directors or any committee thereof,
except as provided, and only to the extent set forth, in Section 5.1(b)
hereof.   Section 1.3 DIRECTORS.   (a) Effective upon the acceptance of
any Shares for payment by Parent or Sub or any of its affiliates pursuant to
the Offer (the "APPOINTMENT TIME"), Parent shall be entitled to elect or
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board of Directors as is equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the
directors elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially
owned by Sub, Parent and any of their affiliates bears to the total number of
Shares then outstanding. The Company shall, upon Parent\'s request, promptly
increase the size of the Company Board of Directors, including by amending
the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to increase the size of the
Company Board of Directors, or promptly secure the written resignations
of such number of its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to
enable Parent\'s designees to be so elected or designated to the Company
Board of Directors, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Parent\'s designees to be so elected or designated at such time. At the
Appointment Time, the Company shall, upon Parent\'s request, also cause
persons elected or designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors
of (i) each committee of the Company Board of Directors; (ii) each board of
directors (or similar body) of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries; and (iii)
each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case only to the
extent permitted by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange or
trading market on which the Company\'s common stock is listed or traded after
giving effect to the foregoing changes to the composition of the Company\'s
Board of Directors. The Company\'s obligations under this Section 1.3(a)
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this
Agreement take all actions required pursuant to such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including, but not limited to, mailing to record and beneficial
holders of the Shares as of a recent date (together with the Schedule 14D-9)
the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l as is necessary to
enable Parent\'s designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board
of Directors. Parent or Sub shall supply the Company, in writing, and be
solely responsible for    6   information with respect to either of them
and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of Sub, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of
Shares as a matter of law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.   (b) In the event that Parent\'s designees are elected or
designated to the Company Board of Directors, then, until the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to have at least two
(2) directors who are directors on the date hereof including at least two (2)
members who are independent directors for purposes of the continued listing
requirements of the Nasdaq National Market (the "INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS"),
provided, however, that if any Independent Director is unable to serve due to
death or disability, the remaining Independent Directors shall be entitled to
elect or designate another person (or persons) who serves as a director on
the date hereof to fill such vacancy, and such person (or persons) shall be
deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no
Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate two
(2) persons who are directors on the date hereof (or, in the event there
shall be less than two (2) directors available to fill such vacancies as a
result of such persons\' deaths, disabilities or refusals to serve, such
smaller number of persons who are directors on the date hereof) to fill such
vacancies and such persons shall be deemed Independent Directors for purposes
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if Parent\'s designees constitute a majority of the Company Board
of Directors after the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer
and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of
the Independent Directors (or if only one exists, then the vote of such
Independent Director) shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this
Agreement by the Company; (ii) exercise or waive any of the Company\'s
rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would adversely affect
holders of Shares other than Parent or Sub; (iii) amend the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company if such action would adversely affect
holders of Shares other than Parent or Sub; or (iv) take any other action of
the Company Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if
such action would adversely affect holders of Shares other than Parent or
Sub; provided, however, that if there shall be no Independent Directors as a
result of such persons\' deaths, disabilities or refusal to serve, then such
actions may be effected by majority vote of the entire Board of Directors of
the Company.   Section 1.4 THE MERGER.   Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), the Forward Merger shall be effected
and the Company shall be merged with and into Sub at the Effective Time with
the separate corporate existence of the Company ceasing and Sub continuing as
the surviving corporation; provided, however, that if Parent does not obtain
the Tax Opinion (as defined herein), then the Reverse Merger shall be
effected, with the separate corporate existence of Sub (or another direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, as determined by Parent in its
sole discretion) ceasing and the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation. The surviving corporation of the Forward Merger or the Reverse
Merger, as the case may be, shall be herein referred as the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION" and the Forward Merger and Reverse Merger shall collectively be
referred to as the "MERGER". The Surviving Corporation shall become a direct
or    7   indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and shall succeed
to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in
accordance with the DGCL.   Section 1.5 CLOSING.   The closing of the
Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be
specified by the parties (the "CLOSING DATE"), which shall be no later than
the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable
Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 525 University Ave., Ste. 1100, Palo
Alto, California, unless another date or place is agreed to by the parties
hereto.   Section 1.6 EFFECTIVE TIME.   Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file
a certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   Section 1.7 CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS.   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.   (b) The Bylaws of Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.   Section 1.8 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION.   (a) The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.   (b) The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.   Section 1.9 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER.   At and after the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective T    8   ime all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Sub shall be vested in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   Section 1.10 SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS.   If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole
discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments,
assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its
right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of either of the Company or Sub acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.   ARTICLE II   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1
EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares or any shares
of capital stock of Parent or Sub:   (a) Capital Stock of Sub. In the event
of a Forward Merger, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of
Sub shall remain as one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001, of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event of a Reverse Merger, then each issued and
outstanding share of capital stock of Sub (or another direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion) shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock. Each Share that is
owned by the Company, Parent or Sub (except for Shares that are owned by Sub,
in the event of a Reverse Merger) shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no Parent Common Stock or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c)Conversion of Company Common
Stock.   (i)Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and other    9   than Shares owned by Sub in the event
of a Reverse Merger) shall be converted into the right to receive the
Exchange Offer Consideration (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").   (ii) As of the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
or similar transaction (without duplication of any adjustments made pursuant
to Section 1.1(a)).   (iii) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to
the contrary in this Agreement, appropriate modifications shall be made to
the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section
2.1) in the event of a Reverse Merger.   Section 2.2 EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with Equiserve, L.P. or such other bank or trust company as may be
designated by Parent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") and which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective
Time and any cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND") issuable and
payable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for Shares. Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed, cash sufficient
to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c).   (b)
Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "CERTIFICATES") whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify and shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be   
10   required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking
into account all the Shares then held by such holder under all such
Certificates so surrendered, (y) cash which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking into
account all the Shares then held by such holder under all such Certificates
so surrendered (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e)),
and (z) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) (in each case after giving effect to any required
withholding taxes), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no certificate representing Parent Common Stock or cash (including in
lieu of a fractional share interest) shall be delivered to a Person who is an
"affiliate" (as contemplated by Section 5.10 hereof) of the Company unless
such affiliate has theretofore executed and delivered to Parent the agreement
referred to in Section 5.10. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock as contemplated by Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e) until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be
required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, less the
amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.    11   
(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
previously represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.   (e) No Fractional Shares.   (i) No
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.   (ii) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Shares exchanged pursuant to the
Offer or the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount, less the amount of any withholding taxes, as
contemplated by Section 2.2(f), which are required to be withheld with
respect thereto, equal to the product of (A) such fractional part of a share
and (B) Parent Market Price.   (f) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   (g)
Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. Any such portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.    12    (h) No
Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund,
in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (i) Investment of Exchange
Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis, provided that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts
payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (j) Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof, in each case pursuant to this Agreement.   (k) Stock
Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange
Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be converted into the
Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).   Section 2.3 DISSENTING SHARES.  
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "DISSENTING
SHARES") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
loses his or her right to appraisal. A holder of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him
or her in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his or her
right to appraisal, in which case such Shares shall be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates
representing such Shares, pursuant to Section 2.2.   (b) The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments   
13   served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
rights of appraisal; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in the conduct
of all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.  
ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   Section 3.1 REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as expressly set forth in the Filed
Company SEC Documents filed since December 31, 2000 or on the disclosure
memorandum delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement and initialed on behalf of Parent and the
Company, which disclosure memorandum specifies the section or subsection of
this Agreement to which the exception relates (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
MEMORANDUM"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as
follows:   (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the
Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the
Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and, to the extent applicable, is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has
made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement complete
and correct copies of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the
comparable organizational documents of each of its Significant
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date hereof.   (b)
Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and
clear of all Liens, and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests. Other
than such Subsidiaries of the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
owns a greater than twenty percent (20%) equity interest or similar interest
in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for a
greater than twenty percent (20%) equity or similar interest in, any
Person. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
obligation or requirement to make any material loan, capital contribution
investment or similar expenditure to or in any Person in excess of $500,000
individually or $1,000,000 to all Persons, except for loans, capital
contributions, investments or similar expenditures by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries. Except as provided by
applicable Law, there are no restrictions of any kind which prevent the
payment of dividends by any Subsidiary.    14    (c) Capital Structure.
The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01
per share ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"). At the close of business on December
20, 2001, (i) 38,766,678 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and

shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury,
(iii) 5,623,424 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable pursuant to

or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital stock) other than issuances
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of options outstanding on
December 20, 2001 under Company Stock Plans, and (ii) no options, warrants,
securities convertible into, or commitments with respect to the issuance of

outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares which
may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will be, when issued in
accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. There are no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may
vote. Except (i) as set forth above in this Section 3.1(c), and (ii) for
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under any plan or
arrangement providing for the grant of options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock to current or former officers, directors, employees or
consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries or resulting from the issuance
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Stock Options outstanding as of
the close of business on December 20, 2001, (x) there are not issued,
issuable, reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company, (B) any securities of the
Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital
stock or voting securities of the Company, (C) any warrants, calls, options
or other rights to acquire from the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
and no obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to issue,

the Company or (D) stock appreciation rights or rights to receive shares of
Company Common Stock on a deferred basis granted under the Company Stock
Plans or otherwise; and (y) there are not any outstanding obligations of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any such securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, any such securities. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of
any such securities. Except as set forth in this Section 3.1(c), there are no
issued, issuable, reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company, (B) warrants, calls,
options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, and no obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to
issue, any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in,
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
capital stock, voting securities or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of
the Company or (C) obligations of the Company or    15   any Subsidiary
of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
outstanding securities of Subsidiaries of the Company or to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such securities.
Except as set forth above in this Section 3.1(c), neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any agreement regarding any
securities of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.   (d)
Authority; Noncontravention. The Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (if
required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger) and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously,
by those present at such meeting of the Board of Directors, approved this
Agreement, determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and declared that the Merger is advisable, provided that after
the date hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw its
recommendation as provided in Section 4.2 hereof. Assuming that the
representation of Parent contained in Section 3.2(i) is correct, the Board of
Directors of the Company has taken all action necessary to render
inapplicable, as it relates to the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement and the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, Section 203 of the DGCL. To the Company\'s Knowledge, except for
Section 203 of the DGCL (the restrictions of which have been rendered
inapplicable), no state takeover statute is applicable to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other
parties thereto, constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors\' rights generally or by principles governing availability of
equitable remedies). The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not,
and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any pledge, claim,
lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS") in or upon any of the properties or assets
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company under, (i) the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the comparable organizational
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit agreement,
bond, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or other contract, agreement,
obligation, commitment, arrangement, understanding, instrument, permit or
license applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets or (iii) subject to the governmental filings
and other matters referred to in the following paragraph, any (A) statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation or (B) judgment, order or decree, in each
case applicable to the    16   Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights,
cancellations, accelerations, losses or Liens that individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any supranational, national, state, municipal, local or foreign
government, any instrumentality, subdivision, court, administrative agency or
commission or other authority thereof, or any quasi-governmental or private
body exercising any regulatory, taxing, importing or other governmental or
quasi-governmental authority (each, a "GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY") is required by
or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the
consummation by the Company of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1) the filing of a
pre-merger notification and report form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT") and any
applicable filings and approvals under similar foreign antitrust laws and
regulations, (2) the filing with the SEC of (A) a proxy statement relating to
the meeting of the Company\'s stockholders to be held in connection with
the Merger (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "PROXY
STATEMENT") and (B) such reports under Section 13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or 16(a)
of Exchange Act, as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (3) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in
which the Company is qualified to do business, (4) such filings with
Governmental Entities to satisfy the applicable requirements of state
securities or "blue sky" law and (5) such other consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which
to be obtained or made individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (e) Company SEC Documents. The Company has timely filed all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits
and other information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed
by the Company since January 1, 1999 (the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS"). No
Company Subsidiary is required to file any form, report, registration
statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC. As of their respective
dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), the Company
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "SECURITIES ACT") or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Company SEC Documents filed since December 31,
2000, together with any public announcements in a news release issued by the
Dow Jones news service, PR Newswire or any equivalent service (collectively,
a "DOW JONES NEWS RELEASE") made by the Company after the date hereof taken
as a whole, as of the Effective Time will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the   
17   circumstances existing as of the Effective Time, not misleading. The
financial statements (including the related notes) of the Company included in
the Company SEC Documents, as of their respective dates, complied in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and (except as amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement) fairly presented the financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments not material in amount). Except (i) as set forth in the Filed
Company SEC Documents filed since December 31, 2000 or (ii) for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "FILED COMPANY SEC DOCUMENT"
shall mean a Company SEC Document filed by the Company and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement.   (f) Information in the Form S-4,
Proxy Statement, Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9. None of the information
to be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC
by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger (the "FORM S-4") will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC,
at any time it is supplemented or amended or at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is
first mailed to the Company\'s stockholders and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or
Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement. The Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, as applicable to the Company, except
that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement. The information supplied by the Company
expressly for inclusion in the Offer Documents will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on
the date first published or sent or given to the stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to statements    18   made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or Sub specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9.   (g)
Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in the Filed
Company SEC Documents filed after December 31, 2000 and for
transactions expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, since
December 31, 2000 (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and (ii)
there has not been a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set
forth in the Filed Company SEC Documents and for actions in the ordinary
course of business, since December 31, 2000, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has taken any action, or failed to take any action, which
if such action or failure occurred during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time would constitute a breach or violation of
Section 4.1(a) (i), (ii), (iv), (vi), (viii), (ix), (xi), (xii), (xiii) or
Section 5.12, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
authorized, or committed or agreed, to take any of such actions.   (h)
Litigation. There is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, overtly threatened against or affecting the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule, order, action, demand or requirement of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any investigation by any Governmental Entity involving, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
(i) Contracts. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(A) of the
Company Disclosure Memorandum or listed as an exhibit to the Company\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, and none of their
respective properties or assets are bound by, any "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) (the
contracts listed in Section 3.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum being
referred to as the "MATERIAL CONTRACTS"). Each such Material Contract is a
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries
and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, of the other party or parties thereto, in
accordance with its terms, and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
and to the extent as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights
generally or by general principles of equity. The Company has not received
any notice from any other party to any such Material Contract, and otherwise
has no Knowledge that such third party intends to terminate, or not renew,
any such Material Contract. As of the date hereof, the Company has
made available to Parent true and correct copies of all such contracts.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no other party thereto, is in violation of or in default under (nor
does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving
of notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any loan
or credit agreement, bond, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement, understanding,
instrument, permit or license to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults  
19   that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1(i)(B) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company,
its Subsidiaries nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any of its employees is a
party to or otherwise bound by any agreement or covenant not to compete or by
any agreement or covenant restricting the development, marketing or
distribution of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' products or services or
the conduct of their businesses or by any agreement or covenant granting any
exclusive rights whatsoever.   (j) Compliance with Laws. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all statutes, laws, ordinances,
rules, regulations, judgments, orders and decrees of any Governmental Entity
(other than Environmental Laws) (collectively, "LEGAL PROVISIONS") applicable
to its business or operations, except for instances of noncompliance that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Since January 1, 1998, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure
to comply with, any Legal Provisions, except for such violations or failures
to comply that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has in effect all approvals, authorizations,
certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices, permits and rights of
or with all Governmental Entities, including all authorizations under
Environmental Laws ("PERMITS"), necessary for it to own, lease or operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business and operations as now
conducted, except for the failure to have such Permits that individually or
in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. There has occurred no default under, or violation of,
any such Permit, except for defaults under, or violations of, Permits that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Offer nor the Merger, in
and of itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation of any such
Permit that individually or in the aggregate is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except for those matters that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company: (A) each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and has been, in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws; (B) during the period of ownership or
operation by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any of its currently or
previously owned, leased or operated properties, no Hazardous Material has
been treated or disposed of, and there have been no Releases or threatened
Releases of Hazardous Material at, in, on, under or affecting such properties
or any contiguous site; (C) prior to the period of ownership or operation by
the Company or its Subsidiaries of any of its currently or previously owned,
leased or operated properties, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Hazardous
Material was treated, stored or disposed of, and there were no Releases of
Hazardous Material at, in, on, under or affecting any such property or any
contiguous site; and (D) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have
received any written notice of, or entered into or assumed by contract,
judicial or administrative settlement, or operation of law any
indemnification obligation, order, settlement or decree relating to: (1)
any violation of any Environmental Laws or the institution or pendency of any
suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity
or any third party in connection with any alleged violation of Environmental
Laws or any Release of Hazardous Materials, (2) the response to or
remediation of Hazardous Material at or arising from any of the Company\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' activities or properties or any other properties or (3)
payment for any response action relating to or    20   remediation of
Hazardous Material at or arising from any of the Company\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' properties, activities, or any other properties. The
term "Environmental Laws" means all applicable U.S., state, local and foreign
laws, statutes, treaties, rules, codes, ordinances, regulations,
certificates, orders, directives, interpretations, licenses, permits and
other authorizations of any Governmental Entity and judgments, decrees,
injunctions, writs, orders or like action of any court, arbitrator or other
administrative, judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal or agency of competent
jurisdiction, including any thereof of the European Community or the European
Union having the force of law and being applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, dealing with the protection of health, welfare or the
environment, including, without limitation, flood, pollution or disaster laws
and health and environmental protection laws and regulations, and all other
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and any provincial, municipal,
water board or other local statute, law, rule, regulation or ordinance
relating to public or employee health, safety or the environment; including
all laws relating to Releases to air, water, land or groundwater, relating to
the withdrawal or use of groundwater, and relating to the use, handling,
transportation, manufacturing, introduction into the stream of commerce or
disposal of Hazardous Materials. The term "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS" means any
chemical, material, liquid, gas, substance or waste, whether
naturally occurring or manmade, that is prohibited, limited or regulated by
or pursuant to an Environmental Law applicable to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or their respective properties. The term "RELEASE" means the
spilling, leaking, discharging, injecting, emitting and/or disposing and
placement of a Hazardous Material in any location that poses a threat
thereof.   (k) Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans. There has not been,
since December 31, 2000, any adoption or amendment in any material respect by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any collective bargaining agreement
or any Benefit Plan, or any material change in any actuarial or other
assumption used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any Pension
Plans, or any change in the manner in which contributions to any Pension
Plans are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined.   
21    (l) ERISA Compliance.   (i) Section 3.1(l) of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum contains a list of each pension, retirement, savings,
profit sharing, medical, dental, health, disability, life, death benefit,
group insurance, deferred compensation, fringe, change in control, retiree,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, bonus or incentive, vacation,
sick leave, severance pay, employment or termination, and other material
employee benefit or compensation plan, arrangement, contract, agreement
(including pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement), policy, practice
or commitment, whether formal or informal, written or oral, in each case that
are binding commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries (but, for
purposes hereof, excluding any nonmaterial plan or program maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries for the benefit of non U.S. employees), under
which (1) current or former employees, officers, directors or independent
contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their
beneficiaries) participate or are entitled to participate by reason of their
relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or a sponsor or a fiduciary
thereof or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
rights, properties or assets) is currently bound or (3) with respect to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to make payments or
contributions, including, without limitation, all "employee pension
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes referred to herein as
"PENSION PLANS"), "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA) (sometimes referred to herein as "WELFARE PLANS") (all of the
foregoing referred to collectively herein as "BENEFIT PLANS"), and all other
Benefit Plans maintained, or contributed to, by the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any Person or entity that, together with the Company, is treated as a
single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a
"COMMONLY CONTROLLED ENTITY") for the benefit of any current or former
officers, directors, employees or independent contractors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or their beneficiaries) (including any such plans
maintained for current or former foreign employees). The Company has made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (1) each Benefit
Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans, descriptions thereof),
(2) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 required to be filed with the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each Benefit Plan, (3)
the most recent summary plan description for each Benefit Plan for which such
summary plan description is required and (4) each trust agreement and group
annuity contract relating to any Benefit Plan. Each Benefit Plan has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. The
Company, its Subsidiaries and all the Benefit Plans are all in compliance in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and
all other applicable Legal Provisions. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, with respect to any Benefit Plan
maintained, sponsored or contributed to primarily for the benefit of persons
residing and providing services to the Company or its Subsidiaries outside of
the United States, the term "BENEFIT PLAN" as used herein shall only include
such non United States Benefit Plans that are material Benefit Plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.   (ii) All Pension Plans are the subject of a
determination letter from the IRS to the effect that such Pension Plans are
qualified (or the Company has time remaining to apply under applicable
regulations or IRS pronouncements to make any amendment necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or opinion letter) and exempt from United States
Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the
Code, and no such    22   determination letter has been revoked nor to
the Company\'s Knowledge, has any event occurred since the date of its most
recent determination letter or application therefor that would adversely
affect its qualification.   (iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly
Controlled Entity has (1) at any time in the six (6) years prior to the
Closing Date maintained or contributed to any Benefit Plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (2) has
any unsatisfied liability under Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA,
Section 412 of the Code or Section 4980B of the Code. None of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, or any Commonly Controlled Entity contributes to a "multi-
employer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.   (iv) With respect to
any Benefit Plan (other than employment agreements or any other individual
contract), there are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written
or oral, that would prevent any such Benefit Plan (including any such plan
covering retirees or other former employees, other than agreements with
individuals) from being amended or terminated without material liability to
the Company on or at any time after the Effective Time.   (v) No pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, overtly threatened disputes, lawsuits,
claims (other than routine claims for benefits), investigations, audits or
complaints to, or by, any Person or Governmental Entity have been filed or
are pending with respect to any Benefit Plans of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with any Benefit Plan or the fiduciaries or
administrators thereof that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
material liability. With respect to each Benefit Plan, there has
not occurred, and neither the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, the
plan sponsor nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, a plan fiduciary that the
Company has an obligation to indemnify or is contractually bound to enter
into, any nonexempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, nor any transaction that would
result in a material civil penalty being imposed under Section 409 or 502(i)
of ERISA.   (vi) There are no unfunded liabilities with respect to
any Benefit Plan other than those that would not individually or in the
aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   (vii) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, all contributions to and payments
with respect to or under the Benefit Plans that are required to be made with
respect to periods ending on or before the Effective Time have been made or
accrued before the Effective Time by the Company in accordance with the
appropriate plan documents, financial statements, actuarial report,
collective bargaining agreements or insurance contracts or arrangements.  
(viii) No Welfare Plan providing medical or death benefits (whether or not
insured) with respect to current or former employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary continues such coverage or provides such benefits beyond their
date of retirement or other termination of service (except as required by
Code Section 4908B or applicable state healthcare continuation law(s)).   
23    (ix) The execution of, and performance of the
transactions contemplated in, this Agreement will not (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event
under any plan, policy, arrangement or agreement (including under any
collective bargaining agreement) or any trust or loan that will or would
reasonably be expected to result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration of, forgiveness of indebtedness owing from, vesting
of, distribution of, or increase in or obligation to fund, any benefits with
respect to any current or former employee, director or consultant of the
Company.   (m) Labor Relations. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement,
contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor
organization. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
overtly threatened (i) union organizational campaign effort, collective
bargaining negotiations, bargaining impasse, implementation of final offer,
work to rule or intermittent strike or (ii) labor dispute, grievance or
arbitration matter, economic or unfair labor practice strike, boycott, work
stoppage or slowdown involving, in each case of this clause (ii), a material
number of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, no lockout is in effect and no permanent or
temporary strike replacements are currently employed at any Company facility.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor their respective
representatives or employees, has committed any unfair labor practices in
connection with the operation of the respective businesses of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened charge, complaint, decision, order, notice
posting requirement, settlement agreement or injunctive action or order
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the National Labor
Relations Board or any similar governmental or adjudicatory agency or court,
except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries have in the
past been and are in compliance in all respects with all applicable
collective bargaining agreements and Legal Provisions respecting employment,
employment practices, employee classification, labor relations, safety and
health, wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment, except where the
failure to be in compliance would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has complied in all
material respects with its payment obligations to all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of all wages, salaries, commissions,
bonuses, benefits and other compensation due and payable to such employees
under any Company or Company Subsidiary policy, practice, agreement, plan,
program or any statute or other law. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has experienced within the past twelve (12) months a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning of the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. ss.ss. 2101 et seq.   (n) Taxes.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by it, or requests for extensions to file such Tax
Returns have been timely filed and granted and have not expired, and all such
filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all respects, except for such
failures to (i) file, (ii) have extensions granted that remain in effect
or (iii) be complete and accurate in all respects, as applicable, as would
not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has paid (or the Company has paid on its behalf) all Taxes
required to be paid by it, except for such failures to pay as would
not,    24   individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The most recent financial
statements contained in the Filed Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate
reserve for all Taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such
financial statements, except for such failures to reflect such reserves as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No deficiencies for any Taxes have
been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for on the Company\'s financial
statements in accordance with GAAP except for such failures to so reserve as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(n)
of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, no Company income or franchise Tax
Return has ever been examined or audited by any Governmental Entity. No
requests for waivers of the time to assess any Taxes against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries have been granted that remain in effect. No claim has
ever been made in writing by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for
Taxes upon any of the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries except Liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable or for Taxes that are being
disputed in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate
reserves under GAAP exist on the books of the Company. Neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action or
has Knowledge of any fact or circumstance (other than as a result of a
decline in the market price of Parent Common Stock) that is reasonably likely
to prevent the Transaction from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. As used in this Agreement, "TAXES"
shall include all U.S. Federal, state and local, domestic and foreign,
income, franchise, property, sales, use, excise and other taxes, of any
nature whatsoever, tariffs or similar governmental charges, including any
obligations for withholding taxes from payments due or made to any other
person, together with all interest, penalties or additions to tax imposed
with respect to such amounts and "TAX RETURNS" shall include any return,
report or similar statement (including attached schedules) required to be
filed with respect to any Tax, including, without limitation, any information
return, claim for refund, amended return or declaration of estimated Tax.  
(o) No Excess Parachute Payments; No Section 162(m) Payments. There will be
no payments or benefits to any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code) that would constitute or result in an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code as a direct or indirect
consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, as a result of the acceleration of vesting
or exercisability of any options to purchase Company Common Stock held
by "disqualified individuals" as a direct or indirect consequence of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No such Person is entitled
to receive any additional payment from the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Person in the event that the excise tax of Section 4999(a) of
the Code is imposed on such Person. The Benefit Plans and other Company
employee compensation arrangements in effect as of the date of this Agreement
have been designed so that the disallowance of a deduction under Section
162(m) of the Code for employee remuneration will not apply to any amounts
paid or payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such plan
or arrangement.    25     (p) Title to Properties.   (i) Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or valid
leasehold interests in, all its properties and assets except for such as are
no longer used or useful in the conduct of its businesses or as have been
disposed of in the ordinary course of business and except for failures to
have, or defects in title or interests, easements, restrictive covenants and
similar encumbrances that individually or in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All
such material assets and properties, other than assets and properties in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a leasehold interest, are
free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens that individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.   (ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied
in all respects with the terms of all leases to which it is a party and under
which it is in occupancy, and all such leases are in full force and effect,
except for such noncompliance or failure to be in full force and effect that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such
leases, except for failures to do so that individually or in the aggregate
are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   (q) Intellectual Property.   (i) Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries owns, or is validly licensed or otherwise has the right to use
(in each case free and clear of all Liens) all patents, patent applications,
trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights, service marks,
service mark rights, copyrights and other proprietary intellectual property
rights, computer programs and other technology (collectively, "INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS") which if the Company or its Subsidiaries did not own or
validly license or otherwise have the right to use would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Section 3.1(q) of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth, as of the date hereof, a list
of all granted patents, pending patent applications, trademarks and
applications therefor owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  
(ii) In each of the following cases, except for those matters that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (A) the use of any Intellectual
Property Rights by the Company and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on or
otherwise violate the rights of any Person and is in accordance with any
applicable license pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property Rights; (B) no
Person is challenging or, to the Knowledge of the Company, infringing on or
otherwise violating any right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Intellectual Property Right owned by and/or licensed to the
Company or its Subsidiaries; and (C) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or otherwise has Knowledge of
any pending claim, order or proceeding with respect to any Intellectual
Property Right used by the Company and its Subsidiaries and to its Knowledge
no Intellectual Property Right owned and/or licensed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would reasonably
be    26   expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property Right.   (iii) The Company
has no Knowledge that the use of its material Intellectual Property Rights in
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted or as
presently contemplated does or will infringe (A) any granted patent or
existing trademark or (B) any patent granted from a pending patent
application.   (iv) In each of the following cases, except for those
matters that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
(A) constitute a breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any instrument
or agreement governing any Intellectual Property Rights owned by or licensed
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "COMPANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS"), (B) pursuant to the terms of any license or agreement relating to
any Company Intellectual Property Rights, cause the modification of any terms
of any such license or agreement, including but not limited to the
modification of the effective rate of any royalties or other payments
provided for in any such license or agreement, (C) cause the forfeiture or
termination of any Company Intellectual Property Rights under the
terms thereof, (D) give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any
Company Intellectual Property Rights under the terms thereof or (E) impair
the right of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent to make, have made, offer for sale, use, sell, export or license any
Company Intellectual Property Rights or portion thereof pursuant to the terms
thereof.   (v) The Company has no Knowledge of any facts which would
cause it to reasonably believe that either the Offer or the Merger (including
the assignment by operation of law of any contract to the Surviving
Corporation) will result in: (A) the granting by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Sub in the case of a Forward Merger and other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries in the case of a Reverse Merger) of any
rights or licenses to any material Intellectual Property Rights of Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent to any third party (including a covenant not to sue
with respect to any material Intellectual Property Rights of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent) which granting, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole or (B) the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Sub in the
case of a Forward Merger and other than the Company and its Subsidiaries in
the case of a Reverse Merger) being bound by any material non-compete or
other material restriction on the operation of any business of the Parent or
its Subsidiaries (such materiality to be determined with respect to Parent
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole).   (r) Voting Requirements. The
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock to adopt this Agreement (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL") is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital
stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated hereby. No vote of any holders of any class or series of the
Company\'s capital stock is necessary to adopt this Agreement or approve the
transactions contemplated hereby in the event that Parent shall acquire
at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares in the Offer, other
than,    27   subject to the satisfaction of (to the extent permitted
hereunder) waiver of all conditions to the Merger, in accordance with Section
253 of the DGCL.   (s) Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person, other than Lazard Freres and Co., LLC, the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any broker\'s,
finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company.   (t) Opinion of
Financial Advisor. The Company has received the opinion of Lazard Freres and
Co., LLC, dated the date hereof, to the effect that, as of such date, the
consideration to be paid in the Offer and the Merger is fair from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.   (u)
Certain Business Practices. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor (to the Knowledge of the Company) any director, officer, agent or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, in connection
with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i)
used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other
unlawful expenses relating to political activity, (ii) made any unlawful
payment to foreign or domestic government officials or employees or to
foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns or violated any provision
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or (iii) made any
other unlawful payment.   (v) TMP Agreement. The TMP Agreement was validly
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(f) thereof.   Section 3.2
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB. Except as expressly set
forth in the Filed Parent SEC Documents filed since December 31, 2000 or on
the disclosure memorandum delivered by Parent to the Company immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement and initialed on behalf of the
Company and Parent, which disclosure memorandum specifies the section
or subsection of this Agreement to which the exception relates (the
"PARENT DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM"), Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:   (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each
of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and each of its
Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and, to
the extent applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has made available to the Company
prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of its
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the comparable organizational
documents of each of its Significant Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to
the date hereof.    28    (b) Capital Structure. The authorized capital
stock of Parent consists of 5,000,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and
10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share ("PARENT
PREFERRED STOCK"). At the close of business on December 20, 2001, (i)
574,645,471 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii)
5,384,423 shares of Parent Common Stock were held by Parent in its treasury,
(iii) 137,136,206 shares of Parent Common Stock were issuable pursuant to
outstanding Parent Stock Options and (iv) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock
were issued or outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent
Common Stock are, and all shares of Parent Common Stock which may be issued
pursuant to this Agreement will be, when issued in accordance with the terms
hereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to preemptive rights. As of the date hereof there are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Parent having the right to vote
(or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which stockholders of Parent may vote. Except (i) as
set forth above in this Section 3.2(b), and (ii) for shares of Parent Common
Stock reserved for issuance under any plan or arrangement providing for the
grant of options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock to current
or former officers, directors, employees or consultants of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (the "PARENT STOCK PLANS") or resulting from the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to options or other benefits issued or
granted pursuant to Parent Stock Plans outstanding as of the close of
business on December 20, 2001, as of the date hereof (x) there are not
issued, issuable, reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of Parent, (B) any securities of
Parent convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital
stock or voting securities of Parent, (C) any warrants, calls, options or
other rights to acquire from Parent or any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries, and no
obligation of Parent or any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries to issue, any capital
stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of Parent, or (D) any
stock appreciation rights or rights to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
on a deferred basis granted under the Parent Stock Plans or otherwise; and
(y) there are not any outstanding obligations of Parent or any of Parent\'s
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities
or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any
such securities. Neither Parent nor any Significant Subsidiary is a party to
any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any such
securities. Except as set forth in this Section 3.2(b) there are no issued,
issuable, reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) securities of Parent or
any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests
in any of Parent\'s Significant Subsidiary, (B) warrants, calls, options or
other rights to acquire from Parent or any Significant Subsidiary of Parent,
and no obligation of Parent or any Significant Subsidiary of Parent to issue,
any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any capital
stock, voting securities or ownership interests in, any Significant
Subsidiary of Parent or (C) obligations of Parent or any Significant
Subsidiary of Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
outstanding securities of the Significant Subsidiaries of Parent or to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such
securities.   (c) Authority; Noncontravention. Each of Parent and Sub has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by    29   all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the filing of the Certificate
of Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and
Sub, as applicable, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the other parties thereto, constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against
Parent and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms (except insofar
as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors\' rights
generally or by principles governing availability of equitable remedies). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under (i)
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or the
comparable organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan
or credit agreement, bond, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement, understanding,
instrument, permit or license applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective properties or assets or (iii) subject to the governmental
filings and other matters referred to in the following paragraph, any (A)
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or (B) judgment, order or decree,
in each case applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, cancellations,
accelerations, losses or Liens that individually or in the aggregate would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by
or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filings with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Sub or the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1) the filing
of a pre-merger notification and report form under the HSR Act and any
applicable filings and approvals under similar foreign antitrust laws and
regulations, (2) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Form S-4 (B) the Offer
Documents and (C) such reports under Section 13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or 16(a) of
the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement or the
Stockholder Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Stockholder Agreement, (3) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which Parent is qualified to
do business, (4) such filings with Governmental Entities to satisfy the
applicable requirements of state securities or "blue sky" laws, (5)
such filings with and approvals of Nasdaq to permit the shares of Parent
Common Stock that are to be issued pursuant to the Offer and the Merger to be
traded on the Nasdaq National Market and (6) such other consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure
of which to be obtained or made individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.    30    (d) Parent SEC Documents. Except as listed
in Section 3.2(d) of the Parent Disclosure Memorandum, Parent has timely
filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and other information incorporated therein) with the SEC
required to be filed by Parent since January 1, 1999 (the "PARENT SEC
DOCUMENTS"). None of Parent\'s Subsidiaries is required to file any form,
report, registration statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC. As
of their respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of such
filing), the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Parent
SEC Documents filed since December 31, 2000, together with any public
announcements in a Dow Jones News Release made by Parent after the date
hereof taken as a whole, as of the Effective Time will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances existing as of the Effective Time, not misleading. The
financial statements (including the related notes) of Parent included in the
Parent SEC Documents, as of their respective dates, complied in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and (except as amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement) fairly presented the financial
position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments not material in amount). Except (i) as set forth
in the Parent SEC Documents filed since December 31, 2000 and (ii) for
liabilities set forth in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, a "FILED PARENT SEC DOCUMENT" shall
mean a Parent SEC Document filed by Parent and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement.   (e) Information Supplied. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the
Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is supplemented or amended or
at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4
will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, respectively, in each case as applicable to Parent
and Sub, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Sub
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4.   (f) Absence of Certain Changes
or Events. Except as set forth in the Filed Parent SEC Documents filed after
December 31, 2000 and for transactions expressly contemplated or permitted by
this Agreement, since December 31, 2000 to the date hereof (i)   
31   Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice and (ii) there has not been a
Material Adverse Effect on the Parent. Except as set forth in the Filed
Parent SEC Documents and for actions in the ordinary course of business,
since December 31, 2000, neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
taken any action, or failed to take any action, which if such action or
failure occurred during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time would constitute a breach or violation of Section 4.1(b) or
Section 5.12, and neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
authorized, or committed or agreed, to take any of such actions.   (g)
Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person,
other than Goldman Sachs and Co., the fees and expenses of which will be paid
by Parent, is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisors
or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent.   (h) No Stockholder Vote. No vote of the stockholders of Parent
is necessary to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection
with the Offer or the Merger.   (i) Ownership of Company Capital Stock.
Neither Parent nor Sub is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years
has it been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section
203 of the DGCL (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). Neither
Parent nor Sub owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) or is
a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of
capital stock of the Company (other than as contemplated by this
Agreement).   (j) Information in the Proxy Statement. None of the
information supplied by Parent or Sub in writing expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto) will, at the date mailed to stockholders and at the
time of the meeting of stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger
(if required under applicable Law), contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.   (k)
Information in the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws
and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published or sent
or given to the Company\'s stockholders, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or Sub with
respect to information furnished by the Company expressly for inclusion in
the Offer Documents.   (l) Financing. Either Parent or Sub has, or will
have available to it upon the consummation of the Offer, sufficient funds
available (through existing credit arrangements or otherwise) to deliver the
cash component of the Exchange Offer Consideration and the Merger   
32   Consideration to all of the Shares outstanding which become entitled
to receive such consideration.   (m) Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action or has Knowledge of any
fact or circumstance (other than as the result of a decline in the market
price of Parent Common Stock) that is reasonably likely to prevent the
Transaction from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.   ARTICLE IV   COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF
BUSINESS   Section 4.1 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.   (a) Conduct of Business by
the Company. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the

the ordinary course consistent with past practice and in compliance in all

actions.   (b) Conduct of Business by Parent. During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, and except as
may be agreed in writing by the Company, or as may be contemplated by this
Agreement or Section 4.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Memorandum, Parent shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to:   (i) (A) declare,

contemplated by this Agreement;   (v) authorize, or commit or agree to
take, any of the foregoing actions; or   (vi) enter into any new line of
business material to Parent\'s operations taken as a whole, other than any

Section 4.2 NO SOLICITATION.   (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of the Company
or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect,
a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or
any group of Subsidiaries which taken together could constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), or any purchase or sale of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
consolidated assets (including stock of its Subsidiaries) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or
exchange offer for, its equity securities that, if consummated, would result
in any Person (or the stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning
securities representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of its total voting
power (or of the surviving parent entity in such    36   transaction)
or the voting power of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such
proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by Parent
or an Affiliate thereof) a "TAKEOVER PROPOSAL"), (ii) have any
discussion with or provide any confidential information or data to any Person
relating to a Takeover Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning a
Takeover Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement a Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iv) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement or propose publicly or
agree to do any of the foregoing related to any Takeover Proposal.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Appointment Time, the Company (and its Board of Directors) shall be permitted
to (i) comply with applicable Law (including Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) with regard to a Takeover Proposal
or make any other disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company, after taking into account the advice of
outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with applicable
Law (and any such disclosure shall not be deemed a change, amendment or
modification in the Company\'s (or its Board of Directors\') recommendation
to the stockholders of the Company), (ii) change its recommendation to its
stockholders or (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to any Person in response to, an unsolicited bona fide
written Takeover Proposal by such Person that did not result from a breach of
Section 4.1(a) if and only to the extent that, in any such case referred to
in clause (ii) or (iii), (A) the consummation of the Offer shall not have
occurred, (B) (I) in the case of clause (ii) above, it has received an
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal from a third party that did
not result from a breach of Section 4.1(a) and its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and such withdrawal is in connection with the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.1(f) and (II) in the
case of clause (iii) above, its Board of Directors concludes in good
faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Takeover Proposal
could constitute a Superior Proposal and (C) prior to providing any
information or data to any Person or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any Person, it notifies Parent promptly of such inquiries,
proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from, or any
such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with,
any of its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries,
proposals or offers and enters into a customary and reasonable
confidentiality agreement no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company agrees that it will promptly
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any inquiries,
proposals or offers and the status and terms of any discussions or
negotiations, including the identity of the Person making such inquiry,
proposal or offer and will deliver to Parent the information delivered to
such Person to the extent not previously provided to Parent. The Company
agrees that it will, and will cause its officers, directors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any Person (other than the parties hereto)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, and Parent agrees
that no such prior activity shall be considered solicitation of a Takeover
Proposal hereunder. The Company agrees that it will use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly inform its directors, officers, key employees, agents
and representatives of the obligations undertaken in    37   this
Section 4.2. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.2 by any
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.2 by the Company. Nothing in this
Section 4.2 shall (i) permit Parent or the Company to terminate this
Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article VII) or (ii) affect or
limit any other obligation of Parent or the Company under this Agreement
except as explicitly provided herein. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if requested by a third party, the Company may
waive any "standstill" or similar provisions in favor of the Company in any
agreement with such third party if the Board of Directors reasonably believes
that there is a reasonable likelihood that third party will submit a bona
fide Takeover Proposal that could constitute a Superior Proposal, and any
such waiver shall not be construed as a breach of this Section 4.2.  
ARTICLE V   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   Section 5.1 PREPARATION OF THE PROXY
STATEMENT; STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS   (a) If approval by the Company\'s
stockholders is required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger,
as promptly as practicable after the acceptance for exchange of Shares
pursuant to the offer, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC under
the Exchange Act the Proxy Statement and use all reasonable efforts to have
the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after the
acceptance by Parent for exchange of Shares pursuant to the Offer. Subject to
Section 4.2, each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement shall have
cleared the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub will promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and the Company will cause the
Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy
Statement before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company agrees to
provide Parent, Sub and their counsel with any comments that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the receipt of such comments
and to consult with Parent, Sub and their counsel prior to responding to any
such comments. The Company will advise Parent of the time when the SEC has
cleared the Proxy Statement, promptly after it receives notice thereof.  
(b) If approval of the stockholders is required by applicable Law in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company shall establish, prior to or as soon as
practicable following the date upon which the Proxy Statement has
been cleared by the SEC, a record date (which shall be prior to or as soon
as practicable following the date upon which the Proxy Statement has been
cleared by the SEC) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a   
38   meeting of its stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS MEETING") for
the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the
Merger and (with the consent of Parent) such other matters as may in the
reasonable judgment of the Company be appropriate for consideration at the
Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 1.2(c) hereof, and except as expressly permitted by
this Agreement, shall not withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent its recommendation. The Company shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting are solicited, in compliance with all applicable Legal Provisions.
Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the
Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (other
than for the absence of a quorum) without the consent of Parent. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall include the Recommendations in the Proxy
Statement as such Recommendations pertain to the Merger and this Agreement.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger and shall take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of stockholders required by the DGCL to effect the Merger.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company agrees that
its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
the holders of Company Common Stock, as required by this Section 5.1(b),
shall not be affected by the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
Recommendations and (ii) the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.1(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover
Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) above, if
Parent shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares
in the Offer (and if permitted Section 253 of the DGCL), subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted hereunder) waiver of all conditions
to the Merger, the parties hereto shall take all necessary actions to cause
the Merger to become effective, as soon as practicable after the acceptance
for exchange and purchase of such Shares pursuant to the Offer, without a
meeting of stockholders, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.  
Section 5.2 LETTERS OF THE COMPANY\'S ACCOUNTANTS.   The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter from
KPMG LLP, the Company\'s independent public accountants, dated a date within
two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Form S-4 shall become
effective addressed to Parent and the Company, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for
comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.   Section 5.3
[RESERVED]   Section 5.4 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Upon
reasonable notice, each party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives of the other party reasonable access during normal
business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to such of its
properties,    39   books, contracts, commitments, records, officers and
employees as the other party may reasonably request and, during such period,
such party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed, published, announced or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, as
applicable (other than documents which such party is not permitted to
disclose under applicable Law), and (b) consistent with its legal
obligations, all other information concerning it and its business, properties
and personnel as such other party may reasonably request; provided, however,
that either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that it
reasonably concludes, after consultation with outside counsel, that (i) any
Legal Provision of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires
such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any properties or
information, (ii) providing such access would result in the loss of the
attorney client privilege, (iii) such document discusses the pricing
or dollar value of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv)
the documents contain competitively sensitive information, the sharing of
which could constitute a violation of any applicable antitrust laws. The
parties shall hold any such information in confidence to the extent required
by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter agreements dated as
of December 13, 2001 and December 19, 2001, respectively, between Parent and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT"). Each party shall make all reasonable best efforts to minimize
disruption to the business of the other party and its Subsidiaries which may
result from the requests for data and information hereunder. All requests for
access and information shall be coordinated through senior executives of the
parties to be designated. Any investigation by Parent or the Company shall
not affect the representations and warranties of Parent or the Company, as
the case may be.   Section 5.5 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.   (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following:   (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing to be satisfied,   (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking
of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity,  
(iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
third parties other than Governmental Entities (provided that if obtaining
any such consent, approval or waiver would require any action other than the
payment of a nominal amount, such action shall be subject to the consent of
Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld),    40    (iv) the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and   (v) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing Parent, Sub and the Company and their
respective Boards of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
necessary, with the reasonable cooperation of the other parties hereto if
reasonably requested, to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, on an advisory
basis, in the defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Regulatory
Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law and to take all other
actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. "REGULATORY LAW"
means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable
federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate (i) foreign investment
or (ii) actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition.   (c) Each of Parent and the Company
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.5(b) to obtain
all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) subject to Section 5.4 and unless prohibited
from doing so by applicable Law, permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the      41      extent appropriate or
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.   (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall
require any of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its
Subsidiaries to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct any
portion of their business in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct any portion of their business in
a specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition
of, any assets of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or the
conduct of their business in a specified manner, whether as a condition to
obtaining any approval from a Governmental Entity by April 30, 2002 or any
other Person or for any other reason, if such sale, holding separate or other
disposition or the conduct of their business in a specified manner would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries),
taken together, after giving effect to the Merger.   Section 5.6 STOCK
OPTIONS; EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a) As of the Effective Time, (i) each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "STOCK
OPTION") granted under any plan or arrangement providing for the grant of
options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock to current or former
officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the "COMPANY STOCK PLANS"), whether vested or unvested, shall
be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (such option, an "ADJUSTED
OPTION") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the Stock Option, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option by the Option Exchange
Ratio, at a price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (A) the aggregate
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable
pursuant to such Stock Option (assuming all conditions to the exercise of
such Stock Option had then been met) divided by (B) the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Stock
Option; provided, that, such exercise price shall be rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. In addition, any and all repurchase rights under any
Company Stock Plan held by the Company on the shares of Company Common Stock
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, be assigned to Parent and shall be
converted into repurchase rights held by Parent as the corresponding shares
of Parent Common Stock. The Company represents that, prior to the Effective
Time, it shall take the necessary and appropriate actions to evidence that
the option treatment described in this Section 5.6(a) is the appropriate
adjustment as authorized and permitted under the terms of the plans and
agreements pursuant to which the Stock Options were granted. For purposes of
this Agreement, the "OPTION EXCHANGE RATIO" shall equal the quotient of (i)
Ten Dollars and Fifty Cents ($10.50) divided by (ii) the Parent Market
Price.   (b) In the case of any Stock Options that are "incentive
stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and the terms and conditions of such
Stock Options shall be determined in accordance with Section 5.6(a) hereof,
subject to such adjustments as are necessary to comply with the requirements
of Section 424(a) of the Code.      42       (c) Parent shall,
prior to the Effective Time, take all action necessary so that, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further
corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plans with the result
that all obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans with
respect to Stock Options outstanding at the Effective Time, shall be
obligations of Parent, and all Adjusted Options shall be exercisable, on the
same terms as were applicable under the Stock Options, for shares of Parent
Common Stock following the Effective Time, subject to this Section 5.6.  
(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issue a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of Adjusted Options. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a Registration Statement on Form
S-1, Form S-3 or Form S-8 as the case may be (or any successor or
other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such Adjusted Options, and shall maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement and the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein, for so long as such Adjusted Options remain
outstanding. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide that holders of Adjusted Options do not experience
delays in exercising and settling their Adjusted Options.   (e) Parent
shall take, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
take, the following actions: (i) waive any limitations regarding preexisting
conditions and eligibility waiting periods under any health benefit plan
maintained by any of them for the benefit of individuals who are employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"EMPLOYEES") to the extent such preexisting condition or waiting period did
not apply to the Employee under a comparable plan of the Company or its
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
the Effective Time for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs,
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
such health plans, and (iii) for eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan and not to the extent such crediting would result in a
duplication of benefits) under all compensation and benefit plans and
policies applicable to the Employees, treat all service by the Employees with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities before
the Effective Time as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all employment, retention and
severance arrangements (including, without limitation, those set forth on
Section 5.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum) and all obligations to
current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder.
Parent shall take all actions necessary to cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to satisfy the obligations listed in Section 5.6(e) of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum.   (f) The Company shall terminate its
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") in accordance with its terms to
take effect as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time. The offerings
under the ESPP are currently suspended, and the Company shall not commence a
new offering under its ESPP after the date of this Agreement.   (g) The
provisions of this Section 5.6 shall not create in any employee or former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any rights to employment
or      43      continued employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.   Section
5.7 INDEMNIFICATION, EXCULPATION AND INSURANCE.   (a) Parent shall cause all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors or employees or officers of the Company
(each such Person being an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between
such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the
date hereof) to be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, as of the Effective Time and such rights shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in all
of their capacities) to the fullest extent permitted by the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between
such directors, officers and employees for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby).   (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.7 shall promptly notify
the Surviving Corporation, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified
Party to the extent such failure does not materially prejudice the Surviving
Corporation. The Surviving Corporation may, at its own expense: (i)
participate in the defense of any claim, suit, action or proceeding; or (ii)
at any time during the course of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding,
assume the defense thereof, unless the Indemnified Parties (or any of them)
determine in good faith (after consultation with legal counsel) that there
is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict or any
significant issue between the positions of Parent and any of such Indemnified
Parties, provided that the Surviving Corporation\'s counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties. If the Surviving
Corporation assumes such defense, the Indemnified Parties shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at their own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Surviving Corporation. Whether or not the Surviving Corporation chooses
to assume the defense of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall cooperate in the defense thereof. If
the Surviving Corporation fails to so assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel promptly after statements
therefor are received; provided that the Indemnified Parties on whose behalf
expenses are advanced provide (x) a written affirmation of their good faith
belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under
Section 145 of the DGCL has been met, and (y) an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under Section 145 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); provided that, in the event that any claim or     
44      claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims (and the matters
giving rise thereto) shall continue until the disposition of any and all such
claim or claims (and the matters giving rise thereto). The Indemnified
Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to local
counsel) to represent them with respect to a single action unless any
Indemnified Party determines in good faith (after consultation with legal
counsel) that there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this Section 5.7, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.7, and none of the actions described
in clause (i) or (ii) shall be taken until such provision is made. Nothing in
this Section 5.7(b) is intended to modify adversely any existing rights to
indemnification of an Indemnified Party from the Company.   (c) For six (6)
years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain in effect the Company\'s current officers\', directors\' and
employees\' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the
Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy (a copy of
which has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies
of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable to such directors and officers; provided, however, that in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.7(c) Parent shall not be

Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.8(b) are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
If Parent shall successfully bring an action to enforce its rights under this
Section 5.8(b), the Company shall reimburse Parent for its reasonable fees

preventing the consummation of the Offer at the time of such termination.

with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and
the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. In addition to the foregoing, neither Parent nor the
Company shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
or disclosure concerning nonpublic information relating to the other party\'s
business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.   Section 5.10 AFFILIATES.   As soon as practicable after the
date hereof, and in no event more than twenty (20) days prior to the Initial
Expiration Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
Persons who are, at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the
stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule

Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the Merger and such other shares
of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with
the Offer and the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National
Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing
Date.      47       Section 5.12 TAX TREATMENT.   Parent and the
Company intend that the Transaction will qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company shall each
use all reasonable efforts to cause the Transaction to so qualify. From and
after the date of this Agreement, each party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Transaction to qualify, and shall not, without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, knowingly take any actions
or cause any actions to be taken which could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Transaction from qualifying as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent nor any of their respective
affiliates shall take any action or cause any action to be taken which could
reasonably be expected to cause the Transaction to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP, or another nationally recognized United States Federal income tax
counsel or "Big Five" accounting firm (based on the facts and customary
representations and assumptions) that the Transaction will be treated as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the "TAX
OPINION"). Parent, the Company and Sub agree to provide certifications
reasonably requested by counsel issuing such Tax Opinion. Notwithstanding
anything express or implied to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the provisions of this Section 5.12, if the Tax Opinion is not obtained, then
the Reverse Merger shall be effected instead of the Forward Merger.  
Section 5.13 NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS.   Each party hereto shall promptly
notify the other parties orally and in writing of:   (a) the receipt by
such party or any of such party\'s Subsidiaries of any notice or other

may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;   (b) subject to any applicable legal restrictions, the receipt
by such party or any of such party\'s Subsidiaries of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   (c) such party\'s obtaining
Knowledge of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting any of Parent, Sub or the Company, as the case may be, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries which relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and   (d) such party\'s
obtaining Knowledge of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event
which occurrence or failure to occur will be likely to cause the conditions
set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties or obligations of
the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder, or
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.      48       Section 5.14 CONVEYANCE

execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,

payable in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective
Time.   Section 5.15 STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS.   Concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Richard Johnson shall execute and

Stock owned, beneficially or of record, by him to approve the Merger and to
tender all such shares into the Offer, subject to exceptions provided for in
such agreement.   Section 5.16 MATTERS.   Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to the Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter, dated January
12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.

by and subject to Section 5.5.   ARTICLE VII   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND
WAIVER   Section 7.1 TERMINATION.   This Agreement may be terminated at

OF COMPANY AFFILIATE AGREEMENT   THIS AFFILIATE AGREEMENT, dated as of
______________ (the "AGREEMENT"), is made by the undersigned stockholder
("STOCKHOLDER") of HotJobs.com, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"),
in favor of and for the benefit of Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation
("PARENT"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).  
RECITALS   A. Parent and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of December [], 2001 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), pursuant
to which [HJ Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent][OR ANOTHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED
SUBSIDIARY OF PARENT] ("MERGER SUB"), (subject to the conditions set forth
therein) shall commence an offer (the "OFFER") in which each of the issued

of Parent as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement and (B) cash,
without interest, in an amount to be paid in accordance with the Merger
Agreement followed by either the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company or the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the
"MERGER");   B. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement (a) subject to the terms of
the Offer, upon consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for
payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not withdrawn in the Offer, including shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn by Stockholder as of such time, and (b) at the
Effective Time, outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, including any
Company Common Stock owned by Stockholder as of the Effective Time, will be
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock and cash,
without interest, in accordance with Article II of the Merger Agreement;  
C. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder is a material
inducement to Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement; and   D.
Stockholder has been advised that Stockholder may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of the Company, as such term is used for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "COMMISSION") under the Securities Act, although nothing contained
herein shall be construed as an admission by Stockholder that Stockholder is
in fact an affiliate of the Company.   NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be
legally bound, the parties agree as follows:   SECTION 1. REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF STOCKHOLDER.      (a) Stockholder is the holder and
"BENEFICIAL OWNER" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the
number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock set forth beneath
Stockholder\'s signature on the signature page hereof (the "COMPANY SHARES"),
and Stockholder has good and valid title to the Company Shares, free and
clear of any liens, pledges, security interests, adverse claims, equities,
options, proxies, charges, encumbrances or restrictions of any nature.
Stockholder has the sole right to vote and to dispose of the Company
Shares.   (b) Stockholder is the holder of options to purchase the number
of shares of Company Common Stock set forth beneath Stockholder\'s signature
on the signature page hereof (the "COMPANY OPTIONS"), and Stockholder has
good and valid title to the Company Options, free and clear of any
liens, pledges, security interests, adverse claims, equities, options,
proxies, charges, encumbrances or restrictions of any nature.   (c)
Stockholder does not own, of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly,
any securities of the Company other than the Company Shares and the Company
Options.   (d) Stockholder has carefully read this Agreement and, to
the extent Stockholder felt necessary, has discussed with counsel the
limitations imposed on Stockholder\'s ability to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Company Shares, the Company Options, the shares of Parent
Common Stock that Stockholder is to receive in the Offer and/or the Merger
and the options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock that Stockholder is
to receive in respect of the Company Options in connection with the Offer
and/or the Merger. Stockholder fully understands the limitations that this
Agreement and federal and applicable state securities laws place upon
Stockholder\'s ability to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of
securities of the Company and securities of Parent.   (e) Stockholder
acknowledges and understands that the representations, warranties and
covenants made by Stockholder set forth in this Agreement will be relied upon
by Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates and counsel, and that
substantial losses and damages may be incurred by such persons if
Stockholder\'s representations, warranties or covenants are breached.  
SECTION 2. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 145 AND THE SECURITIES ACT.   (a)
Stockholder has been advised that (i) the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock in connection with the Offer and the Merger is expected to be effected
pursuant to a Registration Statement filed by Parent on Form S-4, and the
resale of such shares will be subject to the restrictions set forth in Rule
145 under the Securities Act unless such shares are otherwise transferred
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
an appropriate exemption from registration, and (ii) Stockholder may
be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company. Stockholder accordingly agrees
not to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent
Common Stock issued to Stockholder in the Offer and/or the Merger unless (i)
such sale, pledge,    2   transfer or other disposition is made in
conformity with the requirements of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, (ii)
such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition is made pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (iii)
Stockholder delivers to Parent a written opinion of counsel, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to the effect that such sale,
pledge, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration
under the Securities Act.   (b) Parent will give stop transfer instructions
to its transfer agent with respect to any Parent Common Stock received by
Stockholder pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, and there will be placed on
the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, or any
substitutions therefor, legends stating in substance:   "THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION  TO WHICH RULE
145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES,  AND MAY ONLY BE
TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145, PURSUANT TO AN  EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION  OF COUNSEL,
REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE TO  THE EFFECT
THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT OF
1933."  and   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE
OFFERED, SOLD,  PLEDGED, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH  THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE
AFFILIATE AGREEMENT  DATED AS OF ________________ BETWEEN THE HOLDER OF THIS
CERTIFICATE AND  THE ISSUER, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT MAY BE INSPECTED BY
THE HOLDER OF  THIS CERTIFICATE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF THE ISSUER OR
FURNISHED BY  THE ISSUER TO THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE UPON WRITTEN
REQUEST AND  WITHOUT CHARGE."  The legends set forth above shall be removed
(by delivery of a substitute certificate without such legends), and Parent
shall so instruct its transfer agent, if a registration statement respecting
the sale of the shares has been declared effective under the Securities Act
or if Stockholder delivers to Parent (i) satisfactory written evidence that
the shares have been sold in compliance with Rule 145 (in which case, the
substitute certificate will be issued in the name of the transferee), or (ii)
an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
to the effect that sale of the shares by the holder thereof is no longer
subject to Rule 145.   SECTION 3. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.   
3   Stockholder agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by Stockholder of any covenant, obligation or other provision contained in
this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to Parent) to: (a) a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other provision; and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. Stockholder further agrees that neither
Parent nor any other person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 3, and Stockholder
irrevocably waives any right Stockholder may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.   SECTION 4.
MISCELLANEOUS.   (a) This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same document.   (b) This
Agreement shall be enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. As
used in this Agreement, the term "successors and assigns" means, where the
context so permits, heirs, executors, administrators, trustees and successor
trustees, and personal and other representatives.   (c) If any provision of
this Agreement or any part of any such provision is held under any
circumstances to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then (i)
such provision or part thereof shall, with respect to such circumstances and
in such jurisdiction, be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws so as
to be valid and enforceable to the fullest possible extent, (ii) the
invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof under such
circumstances and in such jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision or part thereof under any
other circumstances or in any other jurisdiction, and (iii) the invalidity
or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of such provision or the validity
or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. Each provision of
this Agreement is separable from every other provision of this Agreement, and
each part of each provision of this Agreement is separable from every other
part of such provision.   (d) This Agreement is made under, and shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to agreements made and to be performed solely therein, without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. In any action between the
parties hereto, whether arising out of this Agreement or otherwise, (i) each
of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery or other Courts of the State of
Delaware; (ii) if any such action is commenced in a state court, then,
subject to applicable law, no party shall object to the removal of such
action to any federal court located in Delaware; (iii) each of the parties
irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury; and (iv) each of the
parties    4   irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such party is to receive notice.   (e) Stockholder shall execute
and/or cause to be delivered to Parent such instruments and other documents
and shall take such other actions as Parent may reasonably request to
effectuate the intent and purposes of this Agreement.   (f) This Agreement
and any Stockholders Agreement between Stockholder and Parent collectively
set forth the entire understanding of Parent and Stockholder relating to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings between Parent and Stockholder relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.   (g) The rights and remedies of Parent under
this Agreement are not exclusive of or limited by any other rights or
remedies which it may have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or
otherwise, all of which shall be cumulative (and not alternative). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights and remedies of Parent
under this Agreement, and the obligations and liabilities of Stockholder
under this Agreement, are in addition to their respective rights, remedies,
obligations and liabilities under common law requirements and under all
applicable statutes, rules and regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall
limit any of Stockholder\'s obligations, or the rights or remedies of Parent,
under any Stockholders Agreement between Parent and Stockholder; and nothing
in any such Stockholders Agreement shall limit any of Stockholder\'s
obligations, or any of the rights or remedies of Parent, under this
Agreement.   (h) This Agreement and all obligations of
Stockholder hereunder are personal to Stockholder and may not be transferred
or delegated by Stockholder at any time. Parent may freely assign any or all
of its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any other person
or entity without obtaining the consent or approval of Stockholder.   (i)
Each of the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations contained
in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger.   (j) Counsel to the parties to the Merger Agreement shall
be entitled to rely upon this Agreement as needed.   (k) This Agreement
shall not be modified or amended, or any right waived or any obligations
excused, except by a written agreement signed by both parties.   (l)
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, this
Agreement and all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
