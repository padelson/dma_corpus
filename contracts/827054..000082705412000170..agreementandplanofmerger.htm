ARTICLE II

THE MERGER

2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving
corporation of the Merger, is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."

2.2 The Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cause the Merger to be consummated under Delaware Law by filing a certificate of merger

date and time as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall mutually agree upon
in writing (the "Normal Closing Due Date"); provided, however, that if the
Closing would occur on a date that is within fifteen (15) calendar days prior

Closing until the first (1st) Business Day following the end of such fiscal
quarter (provided that, in the event of such deferral, the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in
Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(c) and 7.2(e) shall be deemed to have been satisfied at
the Closing if such conditions were satisfied as of the Normal Closing Due
Date). The date upon which the Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is
referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

2.4 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

(a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.13, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation
shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law and such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at
the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "Standard Microsystems Corporation." (b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.13,
the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

2.6 Directors and Officers.

(a) Directors. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(b) Officers. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified.

2.7 Effect on Capital Stock.

(a) Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any
of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(i) Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (B) Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon the
surrender of (A) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") and (B) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares") in the manner provided in Section 2.8 (or in the case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 2.10).

(ii) Owned Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, the Company, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor. (iii) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall
thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Adjustment to Merger Consideration. If, during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, or any record date
for any such purpose shall be established, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted.

(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in
accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii)) and held by a holder who has not voted in
favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the
"Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws
or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under Delaware Law with
respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised
value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holder's right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.7(a)(i), without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be.

(ii) The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law
that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to
settle or settle, any such demands.

(d) Company Compensatory Awards. At the Effective Time, each Company
Compensatory Award then outstanding under any of the Company Plans shall be
treated in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.11.

2.8 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent
for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

(b) Exchange Fund. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II, an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Merger Consideration by (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with Section
2.7(a)(ii)) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "Exchange
Fund").

(c) Payment Procedures. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of shares of
Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
containing customary provisions (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Payment
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (x) surrender
to the Payment Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Payment Agent, or (y) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Payment Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(e) Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, as the case may
be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

2.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.8. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this Article II.

2.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7; provided, however, as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, the Payment Agent shall require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to furnish a bond in
form satisfactory to the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed. The value of the bond of indemnity shall
be calculated by the Payment Agent, based on the value of lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates.

2.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and necessary
action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

commercial agreement or license agreement subject to confidentiality
obligations, in each case, except as is not and would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The consummation of the transactions

identifiable information.

of the Company, there is no obligation to license any of the Company
Intellectual Property Rights to any third party as a result of participation
or membership in any standards body or similar organization. To the Knowledge
of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance
with their current membership in such organizations. (s) To the Knowledge of the Company, no rights have been granted to any

not authorize or knowingly permit any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Third Party conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days following the date hereof) request in writing that
each Third Party that has executed a confidentiality agreement since the date
which is one year prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company or any material portion thereof return
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Third Party by or on
behalf of the Company, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have such information returned or destroyed (to the extent destruction of
such information is permitted by such confidentiality agreement). (b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not (and shall not authorize or knowingly permit
any of their Representatives to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the making, submission
or announcement of an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any inquiry, offer
or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Third Party any non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of assisting or

this Section 6.1 that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (A) engage
or participate in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party and its
Representatives and/or (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives
any information (including non-public information) relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement the terms of

not contain any "standstill" or similar provision that would prohibit such
Third Party from making any Acquisition Proposal) and containing additional
provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this
Section 6.1 (which confidentiality agreement shall be provided to Parent for
informational purposes immediately following the execution and delivery
thereof), provided that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (1) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law, (2) solely with

furnish non-public information to, such Third Party and (3) contemporaneously
with furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such
information has not been previously furnished or made available by the Company
to Parent or any of its Representatives). (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any action taken by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would be a
breach of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1 if taken by the
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.1 by the Company for
all purposes of and under this Agreement; provided, however, that any such
action taken by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than any member of the Company Board, the Company Board's financial
advisor or outside legal counsel or any Senior Member of Management) shall not
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.1 by the Company, unless such
action was authorized, directed or knowingly permitted by any member of the
Company Board or any Senior Member of Management.

(d) The Company shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty-four (24) hours
of its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of its receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information or inquiry with respect
to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal,
including the terms and conditions of, and identity of the Person or group
making, such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(e) The Company shall keep Parent promptly informed of the status and material
terms and conditions (including all material amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and, promptly
upon receipt of any written material amendment or written proposed amendment
of any such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall give Parent a copy
thereof. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with
written notice at least seventy-two (72) hours (or such shorter period as may
be provided to the members of the Company Board) in advance of a meeting of
the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to
consider an Acquisition Proposal, an inquiry relating to a potential
Acquisition Proposal, or a request to provide non-public information to any
Person.

6.2 Company Board Recommendation; Intervening Events.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Section 6.2, the Company Board shall (i)
unanimously recommend that the Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the "Company Board
Recommendation") and (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement.

(b) Subject to the terms of this Section 6.2, at all times during the period
commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII and the Effective Time, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, amend or modify (or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify) in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such offer,
or (iv) resolve or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions (any
of the foregoing, a "Company Board Recommendation Change"; provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Company's delivery to Parent of any notice
contemplated by Section 6.2(c) shall not be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if and only if:

(i) (A) the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that the failure to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would
reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law, (C) prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall have (1) given Parent
at least four (4) Business Days notice (the "Notice Period") of its intention
to take such action (which notice shall include the most current version of
the proposed definitive agreement and, to the extent not included therein, all
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of
the Person making such Superior Proposal) and (2) caused its financial and
legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith any modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed
by Parent, in its discretion, and (D) Parent shall not have made, within the
Notice Period, a written counter-offer or proposal capable of acceptance that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable,
from a financial point of view, to stockholders of the Company, in their
capacity as such, as such Superior Proposal (it being understood that (x) any
material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any revision
in price, shall require a new notice pursuant to clause (C) above and (y)
there may be more than one Notice Period; or

(ii) (A) a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances
occurs or exists after the date of this Agreement with respect to the
business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and not relating in any way to (x) an
Acquisition Proposal or (y) any fluctuation in the market price or trading
volume of the Company Common Stock, in and of itself) that was not known to
the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or
prior to the date of this Agreement (such material fact, event, change,
development or set of circumstances, an "Intervening Event") shall have
occurred and be continuing, (B) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect
such Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company
under Delaware Law, (C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company shall have (1) given Parent at least four (4) Business
Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall include a written
explanation of the Company Board's basis and rationale for proposing to effect
such Company Board Recommendation Change) and (2) if requested by Parent,
negotiated with Parent in good faith during such four (4) Business Day notice
period any modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, in
its discretion, and (D) Parent shall not have made, within the four (4)
Business Day notice period, a written offer or proposal capable of acceptance
that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, would obviate the need for
the Company Board to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change.

(d) The Company shall ensure that any Company Board Recommendation Change (A)
does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the
Company Board and (B) does not have the effect of causing any Takeover Law
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) to be applicable to this Agreement, the
Voting Agreements, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act (including by issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement); provided that any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant
to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar communication to
stockholders of the Company shall be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in such communication.

(f) The Company shall not take any action to (i) approve any transaction
under, or any Third Party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL, (ii) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates) from the provisions on "business combinations"
contained in any Takeover Law or (iii) otherwise cause such restrictions not
to apply, in each case unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a
termination of this Agreement by the Company in accordance with the terms
hereof.

6.3 Company Stockholders' Meeting. Subject to Applicable Law, the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq and the Company's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the "Company
Stockholders' Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (and in no event later than forty (40) days after the commencement
of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company's stockholders) for the
purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with
Delaware Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if there are insufficient
shares of the Company Common Stock necessary to conduct business at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting, the Company may extend the date of the Company Stockholders' Meeting to the extent
(and only to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is
necessary in order to conduct business at the Company Stockholders' Meeting,
(b) the Company may delay the Company Stockholders' Meeting to the extent (and
only to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is
required by Applicable Law, including to comply with comments made by the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement, and (c) the Company may delay the Company
Stockholders' Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company
reasonably determines that such delay is necessary to solicit sufficient
proxies to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 6.1
and Section 6.2, the Company shall solicit from stockholders of the Company
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware
Law and shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders' Meeting. Unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.3, whether or
not (i) the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine
that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that stockholders of
the Company reject it or (ii) there occurs the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the
Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to
the vote of the Company's stockholders with respect to the Merger at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting. The notice of such Company Stockholders'
Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement, a non-binding,
advisory resolution to approve the compensation that may become payable to the
Company's named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and a
resolution to adjourn the Company Stockholders' Meeting will be considered at
the Company Stockholders' Meeting, and no other matters shall be considered or
voted upon at the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

6.4 Proxy Statement. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, the preliminary
Proxy Statement, which filing the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
complete by May 17, 2012. The Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall
furnish all information concerning the Company or Parent as the other party
hereto may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing
with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to Applicable Law, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement, and to cause
the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the
Company, (i) if the Company receives comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, on or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day
immediately following clearance by the SEC with respect to such comments, or
(ii) if the Company does not receive comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, on or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day
immediately following the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in
Rule 14a-6 (a) promulgated under the Exchange Act. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, including in such
filings, amendments, supplements and correspondence all comments reasonably
and timely proposed by Parent. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and
responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith, and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its advisors or
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or other filing with the SEC related to this Agreement or the Merger. If at
any time prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting, any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement does not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, Delaware Law and the rules of the
Nasdaq. Each of Parent and the Company shall share equally all filing and
printing fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Section 6.4
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all fees and expenses payable to any
attorneys, accountants or other advisors incurred in connection with this
Section 6.4, which shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses).

6.5 Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), including using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth
in Article VII hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled; (ii) obtain all necessary
consents, waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts, Leases or
Company IP Agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) so as to maintain and
preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger); (iii) obtain all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods, making all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Entities, if any), and (iv) execute or deliver
any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section
6.5(a), as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act (and each of Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to file such Form within ten (10) Business
Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement), as well as
comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any
foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by the Antitrust Laws of any
applicable foreign jurisdiction. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
(i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings,
(ii) supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate such filings, (iii) supply any additional information that
reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition
or merger control authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction, and (iv)
share equally all filing fees and expenses incurred in connection with filings
made in connection with this Section 6.5(b) (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, all fees and expenses payable to any attorneys, accountants or other
advisors incurred in connection with this Section 6.5(b), which shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses). Each party hereto shall promptly inform
the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication
from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), then such party shall
use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Subject to Applicable
Law, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or written correspondence
with any Governmental Entity or its staff with respect to such Antitrust Laws
shall be made by the Company or Parent without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section
6.5(a), in the event that any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger). (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly understood and agreed that: (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be under any obligation to make proposals, execute or carry
out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for
(A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their business or
own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the shares of Company Common
Stock or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company
Common Stock, other than, in the case of clauses (A), (B) or (C) above, for
any such sale, divestiture, license, disposition, holding separate, limitation
or regulation that would be immaterial to the Parent and/or the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any of the foregoing, an
"Antitrust Restraint").

6.6 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably
disrupt or interfere with business operations, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records, Contracts, Permits, and personnel of the
Company, as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that no
information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions
to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the remedies available to the
parties hereunder; and provided further, that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to Section 6.9) shall apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.6; and provided
further, that the Company shall not be required to, nor shall the Company be
required to cause its Subsidiaries to, afford access or disclose any
information that in the good faith judgment of the Company would (a) violate
any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Third Party,
(b) jeopardize protections afforded the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine, or (c)
violate any Applicable Law or Order. In the event that the Company does not
provide access to or disclose information to Parent in reliance on the final
proviso of the preceding sentence, it shall use reasonable best efforts to
communicate such information in a manner that does not result in the violation
of any such obligation, Law or Order or the jeopardy of such protections.

6.7 Notification.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware (i) that
any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect in a manner reasonably
likely to cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article VII not to be
satisfied, (ii) of any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement in a manner reasonably likely to cause
any condition to Closing set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied or (iii)
of any Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, or any Order, that if existing prior to the date of this Agreement
would have caused the representations and warranties in Section 3.14 to be
untrue or inaccurate; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or
the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and provided further, that
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant
to Section 6.9) shall apply to any information provided pursuant to this
Section 6.7(a).

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, (i) the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or other
communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach
of or material default under any Lease or Material Contract or Company IP
Agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and (ii)
each party shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other
communication received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger); provided, however, that no such notification shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty set forth herein or the
conditions to the obligations of any party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the remedies available to the
parties hereunder; and provided further, that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to Section 6.9) shall apply to
any information provided pursuant to this Section 6.7(b).

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect in a manner reasonably
likely to cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article VII not to be
satisfied, or of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement in a manner reasonably likely to
cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent set
forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder and provided further, that the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to Section
6.9) shall apply to any information provided pursuant to this Section 6.7(c).

6.8 Certain Litigation. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in
writing after becoming aware of any Legal Proceeding commenced after the date
hereof against the Company or any of its directors by any stockholder of the
Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such Legal Proceeding. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and
shall consider Parent's views with respect to such stockholder litigation and
shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

6.9 Confidentiality. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Parent and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality
Agreement, dated February 22, 2012 (as amended, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as
of the execution and delivery hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to be amended so as to permit Parent to make any counter-offer or
proposal contemplated by Section 6.2(c) or Section 8.1(e)(ii) (which deemed
amendment shall survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms or otherwise).

6.10 Public Disclosure. Each of the Company and Parent shall not, without the
prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statement or any written communication to employees that would
reasonably be expected to be required to be filed with the SEC or any oral
communication to more than fifty (50) employees, in each case, with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger),
except (a) as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange, in which case the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, shall make commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the
other prior to any such release or public statement and (b) with regard to a
Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.11 Company Compensatory Awards.

(a) Company Stock Appreciation Rights.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Appreciation Right (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or vests as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (each, a "Cancelled SAR") shall, by virtue of the Merger
and at the direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this
Agreement), be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Cancelled SAR, equal to the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such
Cancelled SAR (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Stock
Appreciation Right Consideration"). The holder of each Cancelled SAR shall
receive at the Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable
thereafter (but in no event later than the Company's first full payroll after
the Effective Time) from the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash equal to
the Stock Appreciation Right Consideration. If the exercise price per share of
any such Cancelled SAR is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Cancelled SAR shall, by direction of Parent (which is hereby given
pursuant to this Agreement), be cancelled without any cash payment being made
in respect thereof. The payment of Stock Appreciation Right Consideration to
the holder of a Cancelled SAR shall be reduced by any income or employment tax
withholding required under the Code or any Applicable Law or as otherwise
agreed by the parties at the time the Company Stock Appreciation Right was
granted.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Appreciation Right (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and does not vest as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) shall be assumed by Parent (each, an
"Assumed Stock Appreciation Right"). Each such Assumed Stock Appreciation
Right shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as
applied to the related Company Stock Appreciation Right immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except
that (A) such Assumed Stock Appreciation Right shall become a stock-settled
award under the Parent Equity Plan as of and following the Effective Time, (B)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Stock
Appreciation Right shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock underlying such Assumed Stock Appreciation Right as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio
(with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (C)
the per share exercise price of each Assumed Stock Appreciation Right shall be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share
at which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per share
rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The assumption of Assumed Stock
Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Section shall be effected in a manner
that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 6.11(a)(ii) will be
construed consistent with this intent.

(b) Company Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each award of
Company Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does not vest as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be assumed by Parent (each, an "Assumed RSU"). The
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSU shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit
award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, rounded down to the nearest whole
share). Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed
RSUs, such Assumed RSUs will be subject to substantially the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related award of Company Restricted Stock Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting schedule
applicable thereto. Any Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion thereof)
that is not an Assumed RSU (each, a "Cancelled RSU") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and at the direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this
Agreement), be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Cancelled RSU, equal to the Merger
Consideration, except as may otherwise be required by Section 409A of the
Code, in which case such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be treated as an
Assumed RSU. The holder of each Cancelled RSU shall, with respect to each
share of Company Common Stock underlying such Cancelled RSU, receive at the
Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in
no event later than the Company's first full payroll after the Effective Time)
from the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration.

(c) Company Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each award of Company
Restricted Stock (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does not vest as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be assumed by Parent (each, an "Assumed RSA"). The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSA shall be equal to the product
of (x) the number of unvested shares of Company Restricted Stock underlying
such RSA as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, rounded down to the nearest whole
share). Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed
RSAs, such Assumed RSAs will be subject to substantially the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related award of Company Restricted Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting schedule
applicable thereto. Any award of Company Restricted Stock that is not an
Assumed RSA shall, with respect to each such share of Company Restricted
Stock, be treated as a share of Company Common Stock that shall be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.7(a)(i).

(d) Company Options.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or vests
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
(each, a "Cancelled Option") shall, by virtue of the Merger and at the
direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), be
cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, with respect to each share underlying such Cancelled Option, equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Cancelled Option (such amount being hereinafter
referred to as the "Option Consideration"). The holder of each Cancelled
Option shall receive at the Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as
practicable thereafter (but in no even later than the Company's first full
payroll after the Effective Time) from the Surviving Corporation, an amount in
cash equal to the Option Consideration. If the exercise price per share of any
such Cancelled Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Option shall, by direction of Parent (which is hereby given
pursuant to this Agreement), be cancelled without any cash payment being made
in respect thereof. The payment of Option Consideration to the holder of a
Cancelled Option shall be reduced by any income or employment tax withholding
required under the Code any Applicable Law or as otherwise agreed by the
parties at the time the Company Option was granted.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and
does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) shall be assumed by Parent (each, an "Assumed Option"). Each such
Assumed Option shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions
as applied to the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except that (A) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall
be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such unvested Assumed Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number
rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B) the per share exercise price
of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
(x) the exercise price per share at which such Assumed Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the
resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each Assumed
Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an
incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Assumed Option
qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, and,
further, that the assumption of Assumed Options pursuant to this Section shall
be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and
424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and
this Section 6.11(d) will be construed consistent with this intent.

(e) Termination of Non-U.S. Company Compensatory Awards. Notwithstanding the
provisions above, Parent may, prior to the Effective Time, determine
reasonably and in good faith, subject to the consent of the Company, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that withholding
consent in reliance on advice of Company counsel shall not be deemed
unreasonable) that any Company Compensatory Award that is subject to the
Applicable Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction may be treated in a manner other
than prescribed by Section 6.11(a) through 6.11(d), as applicable, to the
extent that (i) Parent and the Company reasonably and in good faith determine
that (A) the manner in which such Company Compensatory Award would otherwise
be treated pursuant to Section 6.11(a) through 6.11(d), as applicable, would
result in a violation of Applicable Laws or a materially adverse tax consequence to the individual holding such Company Compensatory
Award in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and (B) such different treatment
is necessary to comply with such Applicable Laws and (ii) such different
treatment is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with Section
6.11(a) through 6.11(d), as applicable. Parent and the Company shall agree at
least ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time to the treatment of any
Company Compensatory Award that will be treated in a manner other than
prescribed by Section 6.11(a) through 6.11(d), as applicable.

(f) Necessary Actions; Form S-8. The Company shall, at Parent's direction
(which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), take all actions necessary
to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.11 under all Company
Plans and Company Compensatory Awards or any other plan or arrangement of the
Company, including delivering all required notices, obtaining all necessary
consents, and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Effective Time), if
available for use by Parent, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) relating to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed or converted
Company Compensatory Awards under this Section 6.11.

(g) Director Stock Appreciation Rights. The Company shall take all reasonable
steps to enter into an amendment with each member of the Company's board of
directors who holds an outstanding Company Stock Appreciation Right under the
Company's 2006 Directors Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, as amended, which
provides for (i) an irrevocable waiver of any right, claim or entitlement to
(A) assumption of such Company Stock Appreciation Right by Parent and/or
Merger Sub, and (B) advance notice regarding treatment of such Company Stock
Appreciation Right in the Merger, and (ii) the director's consent and
agreement with the treatment of such Company Stock Appreciation Right under
Section 6.11 hereof. The form and substance of the foregoing amendments shall
be subject to the prior approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

6.12 Employee Matters.

(a) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding
the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of
Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "401(k)
Termination Date"), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that
such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated. The Company shall provide Parent
evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of
directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The Company Board shall in any
case adopt resolutions effective no later than the Effective Time eliminating
Company stock as the funding vehicle for matching contributions and as an
available investment under any such 401(k) plan, as applicable. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and
approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. As
soon as practicable following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit all
Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in any 401(k) plan
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
401(k) Termination Date to participate in Parent's 401(k) plan, and shall
permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to transfer his or her account
balance when distributed from any terminated 401(k) plan maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any outstanding participant
loans from such 401(k) plans, to Parent's 401(k) plan, except to the extent
accepting such transfers would adversely affect the tax-qualified status of
the Parent 401(k) plan.

(b) The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to: (i) cause the
rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to all current
offering periods to terminate on or prior to thirty (30) days from the date of
this Agreement, and all accumulated payroll deductions allocated to each
participant's account as of such date under the Company ESPP shall be returned
to such participant as soon as reasonably practicable following such date
(without interest) and in any event in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP, and (ii) to cause the Company ESPP to terminate effective as of
the close of business on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall take all necessary actions so that no new offering is commenced
or made under the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement.
Prior to the date actions must be taken under this Section 6.12(b), and
subject to the reasonable review and approval by Parent, the Company shall
take all actions necessary give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Section 6.12(b).

(c) As of the Effective Time, with respect to Continuing Employees, Parent
shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility to participate, levels of benefits and vesting (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual) under each compensation, severance, vacation,
fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, but in which any Continuing Employee
is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and to the extent such credit would not result in a duplication
of benefits. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plans, (i) cause
any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under any U.S. group health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived
with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and
(ii) give each of the Continuing Employee in the U.S. credit for the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual
out of pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for
which payment has been made. Unused vacation days accrued by Continuing
Employees located in the U.S. under the plans and policies of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall carry over to Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and each Continuing Employee
shall be paid by the Company in cash for any accrued and unused vacation days
that Parent and the Company mutually determine are not permitted by Applicable
Law to be carried over. (d) Notwithstanding the terms of any Employee Plan, the Company shall pay to
each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date and who is a participant in the
Company's Management Incentive Plan, Selected Officer Management Incentive
Plan, Employee Incentive Plan or Sales Incentive Plan (each, an "Incentive
Plan") a bonus under the applicable Incentive Plan (the "Stub Bonus") in
respect of the performance period under such Incentive Plan in which the
Closing Date occurs. The Stub Bonus shall be (i) calculated based on the
Company's reasonable estimate of the extent to which it projects that the
performance targets otherwise applicable to such individual's bonus under such
Incentive Plan would have been achieved, (ii) prorated based on the number of
days elapsed in the applicable performance period as of the Closing Date, and
(iii) allocated among such employees substantially in accordance with the
preliminary allocations shared with Parent\'s Chief Executive Officer prior to
the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that no discretion permitted
under the terms of the relevant Incentive Plan may be exercised to increase
the Stub Bonus payable to any such employee in excess of the preliminary
allocation described in the preceding (iii) applicable to such employee. Such
calculations, estimates, prorations, Stub Bonus amounts and allocations shall
be based on the Company\'s reasonable good faith determination, subject to the
review and consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall request that each
participant in the Company's 2008 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
consent to a distribution of their benefit under such Employee Plan in the
form of a single lump sum as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent, the
Company or any of their Affiliates to continue any specific benefit plan or
program, or to continue the employment of any specific person. No provision of
this Agreement shall be construed to create any right to any compensation or
benefits on the part of any Continuing Employee or other future, present or
former employee of Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates.
Sections 6.11 and 6.12 are intended to be for the sole benefit of the parties
to this Agreement, and nothing in Sections 6.11 and 6.12 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder or make any employee or other service provider of the
parties or their respective Subsidiaries a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall operate as an amendment to any
benefit plan maintained by the Company or Parent or their respective
Affiliates. Further, Parent, the Company and their respective Affiliates
retain the right to amend or terminate their benefit plans at any time and
from time to time, subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the terms
of such plans.

6.13 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under their
respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) and all agreements for
indemnification, exculpation of liability or advancement of expenses, in
effect as of the date hereof between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective current or former directors and officers or any
person who becomes a director or officer prior to the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties"). For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present
and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time,
on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable than those
of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option, substitute
therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and amounts
no less favorable to such persons than the DandO Insurance, provided further,
however, that in satisfying its obligations under this Section 6.13(b), Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in
excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such two hundred percent (200%)
amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium") (which premiums the Company represents
and warrants to be as set forth in Section 6.13 of the Company Disclosure
Letter), provided further that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the "Tail Policy") on
the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than the DandO Insurance and for an amount not to exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal
year. In the event that the Company does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent
may purchase a Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event that
either the Company or Parent shall purchase such a Tail Policy prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail
Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 6.13(b) for so
long as such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c) The obligations under this Section 6.13 shall not be terminated, amended
or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under a Tail Policy referred
to in Section 6.13(b) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of
such person. Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in
Section 6.13(b) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.13, with full rights of enforcement as
if a party thereto.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.13. The rights of the Indemnified
Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or
the Tail Policy referred to in Section 6.13(b) (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this Section 6.13 shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents and any and all indemnification agreements of or
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).

6.14 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and payment of any
amounts payable hereunder, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

6.15 Director and Officer Resignations. Prior to the Closing Date, unless
Parent instructs the Company otherwise, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the resignation (in form and substance acceptable to Parent)
of each individual serving as a director or officer of (or comparable position
with) the Company and its Subsidiaries from his or her position as a director
or officer of (or comparable position with) the Company and its Subsidiaries
(and not as an employee, if applicable, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, such resignation shall not (i)
prejudice in any manner any contractual rights such officer or director may
have with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) cause such officer to
cease to become entitled to any benefit under any Employee Plan to which
he/she would otherwise be entitled in his or her position as an officer.

6.16 Proprietary Information Agreements. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each current
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries in Germany and Korea, a valid and
enforceable Employee Proprietary Information Agreement that retroactively
assigns all intellectual property created by each such employee during his/her
employment to the Company or its relevant Subsidiary, in a form to be agreed
upon by Parent and the Company.

resulted in the failure to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval; or

the Company set forth in this Agreement or (B) that any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate
when made or shall have become inaccurate, in either case such that such that
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become inaccurate; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by the Company or
such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company are
curable by the Company through the exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts, then Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(f)(i) until thirty (30) calendar days after
delivery of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach or
inaccuracy, as applicable (it being understood that Parent may not terminate

publicly announced or shall have become publicly known; provided, however,
that the Company Board shall not be required to make any such reaffirmation
(x) prior to ten (10) Business Days after the initial Acquisition Proposal is
received by the Company, (y) during any Notice Period or (z) during any notice
period pursuant to Section 6.2(c)(ii).

or representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties
hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of Section 6.9, this Section

material breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement. In addition
to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement

(including its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of May 1,
2012 by and between Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and the undersigned Stockholder (the "Stockholder") of Standard
Microsystems Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, Parent, Microchip Technology Management Co., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as it may
be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), which provides for,
among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger") with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation of the
Merger and pursuant to which all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
will be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in the
Merger Agreement.

WHEREAS, the Stockholder is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of
shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and the
holder of Company Compensatory Awards (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
that are exercisable or vest for shares of Company Common Stock.

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger
Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder (in the Stockholder's
capacity as such) has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1.Certain Definitions. All capitalized terms that are used but not defined
herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following respective meanings:

(a)"Expiration Date" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) such date and time
as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to Article
VIII thereof and (ii) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective
in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement.

(b)"Person" shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company,
general or limited partnership, trust, unincorporated association or other
entity of any kind or nature, or any governmental authority.

(c)"Shares" shall mean (i) all equity securities of the Company (including all
shares of Company Common Stock, all shares of Company Preferred Stock and all
Company Compensatory Awards and other rights to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock) owned by the Stockholder as of the date hereof, and (ii) all
additional equity securities of the Company (including all additional shares
of Company Common Stock, all additional shares of Company Preferred Stock and
all additional Company Compensatory Awards, warrants and other rights to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock) of which the Stockholder acquires
ownership during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Expiration Date (including by way of stock dividend or distribution, split-up,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares and the like).

(d)"Transfer" A Person shall be deemed to have effected a "Transfer" of a
Share if such Person directly or indirectly (i) sells, pledges, encumbers,
assigns, grants an option with respect to, transfers, tenders or disposes of
such Share or any interest in such Share, or (ii) enters into an agreement or
commitment providing for the sale of, pledge of, encumbrance of, assignment
of, grant of an option with respect to, transfer, tender of or disposition of
such Share or any interest therein, in each case other than in connection with
the exercise or vesting of any Company Compensatory Award (it being understood
and agreed that any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the exercise or vesting of any Company Compensatory Award shall be subject to the
restrictions set forth in Section 2 and clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section
3), provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, "Transfer" does not include
granting a proxy or voting or consent instructions with respect to any matter
other than those specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 3(a).

2.Transfer of Shares.

(a)Transfer Restrictions. The Stockholder shall not Transfer (or cause or
permit the Transfer of) any of the Shares, or enter into any agreement
relating thereto, except (i) by selling already-owned Shares either to pay the
exercise price upon the exercise of a Company Option or to satisfy the
Stockholder's tax withholding obligation upon the exercise of a Company
Compensatory Award, in each case as permitted by any Company Plan, (ii)
Transfers to Affiliates, immediate family members, a trust established for the
benefit of the Stockholder and/or for the benefit of one or more members of
the Stockholder's immediate family or charitable organizations or upon the
death of the Stockholder, provided that, as a condition to such Transfer, the
recipient agrees to be bound by this Agreement and delivers a Proxy (as
defined below) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, (iii) Transfers
pursuant to any Rule 10b5-1 trading plans existing as of the date hereof, or
(iv) with Parent's prior written consent and in Parent's sole discretion. Any
Transfer, or purported Transfer, of Shares in breach or violation of this
Agreement shall be void and of no force or effect.

(b)Transfer of Voting Rights. The Stockholder shall not deposit (or cause or
permit the deposit of) any Shares in a voting trust or grant any proxy or
enter into any voting agreement or similar agreement in contravention of the
obligations of the Stockholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the
Shares.

3.Agreement to Vote Shares.

(a)At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by
written consent of the stockholders of Company, the Stockholder (in the
Stockholder's capacity as such), to the extent not voted by the Person(s)
appointed under the Proxy, shall, or shall cause the holder of record on any
applicable record date to, vote all Shares that are then-owned by such
Stockholder and entitled to vote or act by written consent:

(i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and in favor of each of
the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any action required
in furtherance thereof;

(ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, made in
competition with, or that would result in a breach of, the Merger Agreement or
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and

(iii) against any of the following actions (other than those actions that
relate to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement): (A) any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
assets, reorganization or recapitalization of or involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) any sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) any
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) any material change in the
capitalization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the corporate
structure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (E) any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company, or (F) any other action that is
intended, or would reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote its Shares in its
sole discretion and without any other limitation on those matters other than
those set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) that are at any time or from
time to time presented for consideration to the Company's stockholders
generally. For the avoidance of doubt, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3(a) shall not apply to votes, if any, solely on the election or
removal of directors as recommended by the Company's Board of Directors
(provided such recommendation is not in violation of the terms of the Merger
Agreement).

(b)In the event that a meeting of the stockholders of the Company is held, the
Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of record of the Shares on any
applicable record date to, appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the
Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum.

(c)The Stockholder shall not enter into any agreement or understanding with
any Person to vote or give instructions in any manner inconsistent with the
terms of this Section 3.

4.Agreement Not to Exercise Appraisal Rights. The Stockholder shall not
exercise, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, any statutory
rights (including under Section 262 of the DGCL) to demand appraisal of any
Shares that may arise in connection with the Merger.

5.Directors and Officers. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict a Stockholder
who is a director or officer of the Company from acting in such capacity or
fulfilling the obligations of such office, including by voting, in his or her
capacity as a director of the Company, in the Stockholder's sole discretion on
any matter (it being understood that this Agreement shall apply to the
Stockholder solely in the Stockholder's capacity as a Stockholder of the
Company), including with respect to the matters set forth in Section 6.2 of
the Merger Agreement. In this regard, the Stockholder shall not be deemed to
make any agreement or understanding in this Agreement in the Stockholder's
capacity as a director or officer of the Company, including with respect to
the matters set forth in Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall limit in any way the
Company or its officers or directors from taking actions permitted by the
Merger Agreement.

6.Irrevocable Proxy. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Stockholder shall deliver to Parent a proxy in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the "Proxy"), which shall be irrevocable to the fullest extent
permissible by law, with respect to the Shares.

7.Waiver of Trust. If the Stockholder is party to an Indemnity Agreement with
the Company substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the
Company's Form 8-K filed on November 23, 2005 (an "Indemnity Agreement"), the
Stockholder hereby waives the Stockholder\'s rights pursuant to Section 15 of
the Indemnity Agreement, but solely with respect to (a) the Potential Change
in Control (as defined in the Indemnity Agreement) deemed to have occurred,
for purposes of the Indemnity Agreement, upon the entry by the Company into
the Merger Agreement and (b) the Change in Control (as defined in the
Indemnity Agreement) contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to occur at the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

8.Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder. The Stockholder hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

(a)Power; Binding Agreement. The Stockholder has full power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Proxy, to perform the Stockholder's
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder, and,
assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable
against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Laws affecting or
relating to creditors' rights generally and is subject to general principles
of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or law). 

(b)No Conflicts. None of the execution and delivery by the Stockholder of this
Agreement, the performance by the Stockholder of its obligations hereunder or
the consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (i) result in a violation or breach of any agreement to which the
Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder may be bound, including any
voting agreement or voting trust, except for violations, breaches or defaults
that would not in any material respect impair or adversely effect the ability
of the Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or (ii)
violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, statute, rule, or
regulation applicable to the Stockholder.

(c)Voting Power. The Stockholder has or will have sole voting power, sole
power of disposition, sole power to issue instructions with respect to the
matters set forth in Section 2 and clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 3(a)
and sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in Section 2 and
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 3(a), in each case with respect to all
of the Shares, with no limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such
rights, subject to applicable federal securities laws and the terms of this
Agreement.

(d)No Finder's Fees. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor, finder,
agent or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
adviser's or other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Stockholder in his or her
capacity as such.

(e)No Legal Actions. Stockholder agrees that Stockholder will not in
Stockholder's capacity as a stockholder of the Company bring, commence,
institute, maintain, prosecute or voluntarily aid any action, claim, suit or
cause of action, in law or in equity, in any court or before any governmental
entity, which (i) challenges the validity of or seeks to enjoin the operation
of any provision of this Agreement or (ii) alleges that the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder, either alone or together with the
other Company voting agreements and proxies to be delivered in connection with
the execution of the Merger Agreement, or the approval of the Merger Agreement
by the Company Board, breaches any fiduciary duty of the Company Board or any
member thereof.

(f)Reliance by Parent. The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that
Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the
Stockholder's execution and delivery of this Agreement.

9.Representations and Warranties of Parent. Parent hereby represents and
warrants to the Stockholder as follows:

(a)Power; Binding Agreement. Parent has full power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform Parent's obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
Applicable Laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights generally and is
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or law).

(b)No Conflicts. None of the execution and delivery by Parent of this
Agreement, the performance by Parent of its obligations hereunder or the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result
in a violation or breach of any agreement to which Parent is a party or by
which Parent may be bound, except for violations, breaches or defaults that
would not in any material respect impair or adversely effect the ability of
Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, statute, rule, or regulation
applicable to Parent. 

10.Certain Restrictions. The Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,
take any voluntary action that would make any representation or warranty of
the Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect.

11.Disclosure. The Stockholder shall permit Parent to publish and disclose in
all documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other
disclosure document that Parent reasonably determines to be necessary or
desirable in connection with the Merger and any transactions related to the
Merger, the Stockholder's identity and ownership of Shares and the nature of
the Stockholder's commitments, arrangements and understandings under this
Agreement.

12.No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership
of or with respect to any Shares. Except as provided in this Agreement, all
rights, ownership and economic benefits relating to the Shares shall remain
vested in and belong to the Stockholder.

13.Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
upon request of Parent, the Stockholder shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary to fulfill such Stockholder's obligations under
this Agreement.

14.Stop Transfer Instructions. At all times commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the Expiration Date, in
furtherance of this Agreement, the Stockholder hereby authorizes the Company
or its counsel to notify the Company's transfer agent that, from the date
hereof until the Expiration Date, there is a stop transfer order with respect
to all of the Shares of the Stockholder (and that this Agreement places limits
on the voting and transfer of such Shares until the Expiration Date).

15.Termination. This Agreement and the Proxy, and all rights and obligations
of the parties hereunder and thereunder, shall terminate and shall have no
further force or effect as of the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing set forth in this Section 15 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall relieve either party hereto from liability, or otherwise limit the
liability of either party hereto, for any intentional breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination. This Section 15 and Sections 1, 5, and 16 (as
applicable) shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

16.Miscellaneous.

(a)Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. In
the event any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction holds any
provision of this Agreement to be null, void or unenforceable, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith and execute and deliver an amendment to
this Agreement in order, as nearly as possible, to effectuate, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the original intent of the parties hereto with
respect to such provision.

(b)Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties
hereto may be assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of law
or otherwise) without prior written consent of the other.

(c)Amendments; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a
waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving compliance. (d)Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge
that Parent shall be irreparably harmed and that there shall be no adequate
remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of the
Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any such violation, Parent
shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific
performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to Parent at
law or in equity.

(e)Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing
and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial delivery
service, or sent via telecopy (receipt confirmed) or e-mail transmission to

| EXHIBIT A

IRREVOCABLE PROXY

The undersigned Stockholder (the "Stockholder") of Standard Microsystems
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby irrevocably (to
the fullest extent permitted by law) appoints Microchip Technology
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), acting through any of its
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer,
as the sole and exclusive attorneys and proxies of the undersigned, with full
power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and
related rights (to the full extent that the undersigned is entitled to do so)
with respect to all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that now are
or hereafter may be beneficially owned by the undersigned, and any and all
other shares or equity securities of the Company issued or issuable in respect
thereof on or after the date hereof (collectively, the "Shares") in accordance
with the terms of this Irrevocable Proxy until the Expiration Date (as defined
below); provided, however, that such proxy and voting and related rights are
expressly limited to the matters discussed in clauses (i) through (iii) in the
fourth paragraph of this Irrevocable Proxy. Upon the undersigned's execution
of this Irrevocable Proxy, any and all prior proxies given by the undersigned
with respect to any Shares are hereby revoked and the undersigned agrees not
to grant any subsequent proxies with respect to the Shares until after the
Expiration Date, provided that, the undersigned may grant subsequent proxies
with respect to any matter other than those discussed in clauses (i) through
(iii) in the fourth paragraph of this Irrevocable Proxy.

This Irrevocable Proxy is irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by law,
is coupled with an interest and is granted pursuant to that certain Voting
Agreement of even date herewith by and between Parent and the undersigned
Stockholder (the "Voting Agreement"), and is granted as a condition and
inducement to the willingness of Parent, Microchip Technology Management Co.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub")
to enter into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith
(as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), among
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides for, among
other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger") with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation of the
Merger and pursuant to which all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
will be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in the
Merger Agreement.

As used herein, the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the earlier to occur of
(i) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly
terminated pursuant to Article VIII thereof and (ii) such date and time as the
Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Merger Agreement.

The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are hereby authorized
and empowered by the undersigned, at any time prior to the Expiration Date, to
act as the undersigned's attorney and proxy to vote the Shares, and to
exercise all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with
respect to the Shares (including, without limitation, the power to execute and
deliver written consents) at every annual, special, adjourned or postponed
meeting of stockholders of the Company and in every written consent in lieu of
such meeting:

(i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and in favor of each of
the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any action required
in furtherance thereof;

(ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, made in
competition with, or that would result in a breach of, the Merger Agreement or
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and

(iii) against any of the following actions (other than those actions that
relate to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement): (A) any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
assets, reorganization or recapitalization of or involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) any sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (C) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) any
material change in the capitalization of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the corporate structure of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (E) any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or (F)
any other action that is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to
materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely
affect the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this Irrevocable Proxy
on any other matter. The undersigned Stockholder may vote the Shares in its
sole discretion on all other matters. For the avoidance of doubt, clauses (i)
through (iii) in the fourth paragraph of this Irrevocable Proxy shall not
apply to votes, if any, on the election or removal of directors as recommended
by the Company's Board of Directors (provided such recommendation is not in
violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement).

Any obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the
successors and permitted assigns of the undersigned.

This Irrevocable Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and effect,
automatically upon the Expiration Date.

Dated: May 1, 2012
