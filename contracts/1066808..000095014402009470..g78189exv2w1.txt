regulations and orders enforced or promulgated by the regulatory  authority
with which they were filed.   (2) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries
has engaged in any of the practices listed in Office of the Comptroller of

as will be in effect on October 1, 2002.   (k) MATERIAL CONTRACTS; DEFAULTS.
The Company has Previously Disclosed a complete and accurate list of all

upon notice of 30 days or less and (B) provides for fees or other payments in
excess of $20,000 per annum or in excess of $40,000 for the remaining term of
the Contract;      -23-    (2) any Contract with a third party to
perform services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on a regular or
ongoing basis;   (3) any Contract that contains an "exclusivity" clause
(that is, obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct
business with another party on an exclusive basis or restricts the ability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct business with any
person);   (4) any Loan by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries pursuant
to which total amounts committed or outstanding under such Loan
exceed $1,000,000;   (5) any Contract with a term beyond the Effective Time
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries created, incurred,
assumed, or guaranteed (or may create, incur, assume, or guarantee)

and   (9) any Contract involving a capital expenditure in excess of $50,000
in a twelve month period or $125,000 in the aggregate.  Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, any other party
thereto is in default under any such Contract, and there has not occurred any
event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default. The Contracts referred to in Section
5.03(k)(6) above are on arm\'s-length terms or terms more favorable to the
Company and its Subsidiaries.   (l) NON-COMPETITION/NON-SOLICITATION.
Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any non-competition or non-
solicitation agreement or any other agreement or obligation (1) that limits,
purports to limit, or would limit in any respect the manner in which, or the
localities in which, any business of the Company or its affiliates is or
could be conducted or the types of business that the Company or its
affiliates conducts or may conduct, (2) that would reasonably be
understood to limit or purport to limit in any respect the manner in which,
or the localities in which, any business of the Acquiror or its affiliates is
or could     -24-   be conducted or the types of business that the
Acquiror or its affiliates conducts or may conduct or (3) that limits,
purports to limit or would limit in any way the ability of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to solicit prospective employees or would so limit or
purport to limit the ability of the Acquiror or its affiliates to do so.  
(m) PROPERTIES. Except as disclosed in the financial statements filed in its
SEC Documents on or before the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have good and marketable title, free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens
for current Taxes not yet delinquent, mechanics liens, materialmen Liens, or
other inchoate Liens) to the properties and assets, tangible or intangible,
reflected in such financial statements (including the notes thereto) as being
owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof.
All buildings and all fixtures, equipment, and other property and assets that
are material to its business and are held under leases or subleases by any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are held under valid leases or
subleases enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors\' rights
generally and to general equity principles).   (n) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.
(1) The Company has Previously Disclosed a complete list of all bonus,
vacation, deferred compensation, commission-based, pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
purchase, restricted stock, stock appreciation and stock option plans, all
employment or severance contracts, all medical, dental, disability,
severance, health and life plans, all other employee benefit and fringe
benefit plans, contracts, programs or arrangements and any "change
of control" or similar provisions in any plan, contract, program or
arrangement maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of current or former officers, employees or
directors or the beneficiaries or dependents of any of the foregoing
(collectively, (and including the Specified Compensation Plans) the
"COMPENSATION PLANS") other than plans, programs or arrangements that cost
less than $2,000 per annum to maintain in the aggregate.   (2) With respect
to each Compensation Plan, if applicable, the Company has provided to the
Acquiror, true and complete copies of the existing: (A) Compensation Plan
documents and amendments thereto; (B) trust instruments and insurance
contracts; and (C) two most recent Forms 5500 filed with the IRS.   (3)
Except as Previously Disclosed, each of the Compensation Plans has been
administered and operated in accordance with the terms thereof and with
applicable law, including ERISA, the Code and the Securities Act. Each of the
Compensation Plans that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("PENSION PLAN") and that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all tax law changes
prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has
applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the
applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and
the Company is not aware of any circumstances that would likely result in the
revocation or denial of any such favorable determination letter. None of the
Company, any of its     -25-   Subsidiaries or an Indemnified Party has
engaged in any transaction with respect to any Compensation Plan that has
subjected, or (assuming the taxable period with respect to the transaction
expired as of the date hereof) could subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 502 of ERISA in an amount that would be material. There is no
pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened litigation
or governmental audit, examination or investigation relating to the
Compensation Plans.   (4) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of
ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any "single-employer plan" (within the meaning
of Section 4001 (a)(15) of ERISA) or Multiemployer Plan currently or formerly
maintained or contributed to by any of them, or the single-employer plan or
Multiemployer Plan of any entity (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") that is considered
one employer with the Company under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section
414(b) or (c) of the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE PLAN"). No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than
pursuant to PBGC Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any
Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on
the date hereof. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any
Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no
condition exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be
instituted. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not
expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan
under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on
contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).   (5) All contributions, premiums and
payments required to have been made under the terms of any of the
Compensation Plans or applicable law have been timely made or reflected in
the Company\'s SEC Documents. Neither any of the Pension Plans nor ERISA
Affiliate Plans has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not
waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or any
ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) or Section 412(n) of the
Code.   (6) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of
the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of
the actuarial assumptions contained in the plan\'s most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such plan.
Under each of     -26-   the Pension Plans, there has been no adverse
change in the financial condition of any Pension Plan (with respect to either
assets or benefits) since the last day of the most recent plan year.   (7)
There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
litigation relating to the Compensation Plans. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits
under any Compensation Plan, except as Previously Disclosed. The Company or
the Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without
incurring any liability thereunder. There has been no communication
to employees, former employees or their spouses, beneficiaries or dependents
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that promised or guaranteed such
employees retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death benefits on
a permanent basis or promised or guaranteed that any such benefits could not
be modified, eliminated or terminated.   (8) Except as Previously
Disclosed, there has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Compensation Plan which would increase the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recently ended fiscal year. Except as Previously Disclosed, neither
the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (v) entitle any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date
hereof, (w) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment
or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Compensation Plans, (x) limit or restrict the right
of the Company to merge, amend or terminate any of the Compensation Plans,
(y) cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to record additional
compensation expense on its income statement with respect to any outstanding
stock option or other equity-based award or (z) result in payments under any
of the Compensation Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m)
or Section 280G of the Code.   (9) The Company has Previously Disclosed a
complete list stating the current base salary, 2001 earned incentive
compensation and 2002 target incentive compensation, and additional payments
triggered by the Merger and the Company\'s estimate of the excise tax gross-
up for each such amount for all current officers, employees and directors of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (o) LABOR MATTERS. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, including the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986, any such laws respecting employment discrimination, disability
rights or benefits, equal opportunity, affirmative action, workers\'
compensation, employee benefits, severance payments, labor relations,
employee leave issues, wage and hour standards, occupational safety and
health requirements and unemployment insurance and related matters.
Neither      -27-   the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any collective bargaining Contract with a labor union or
labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject
of a proceeding asserting that it or any such Subsidiary has committed an
unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act) or seeking to compel the Company or any such Subsidiary to bargain with
any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there
any strike or other labor dispute involving it or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened, nor is the Company aware
of any activity involving it or any of its Subsidiaries\' employees seeking
to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational
activity. The consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not entitle any third party (including
any labor union or labor organization) to any payments under any Contract to
which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party.   (p)
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (1) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
complied at all times with all applicable Environmental Laws; (2) to
the Company\'s knowledge, no property (including soils, groundwater,

opinion of outside counsel to the Company or the Acquiror, as the case may
be, is required by law or regulation and as to which the Company or the
Acquiror, as the case may be, has used its best efforts to discuss with the
other in advance, provided that such release or statement has not been caused
by, or is not the result of, a previous disclosure by or at the direction of
the Company or the Acquiror, as the case may be, or any of its
representatives that was not permitted by this Agreement).   6.05 ACCESS;

contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each
party will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives to

not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (3) is
disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to which such
information pertains, (4) is or becomes readily ascertainable from published
information or trade sources or (5) is such that such party is required by
law or court order to disclose. If either party is required or reasonably
believes that it is required to disclose any information described in this
section by (i) law, (ii) any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) any
inquiry or investigation by any governmental, official or regulatory body
which is lawfully entitled to require any such disclosure, such party (the
"REQUIRED PARTY") shall, so far as it is lawful, notify the other party of
such required disclosure on the same day that the Required Party (a) is
notified of a request for such disclosure from the relevant authority, body
or other entity or (b) determines that such disclosure is required, whichever
is earlier. Immediately thereafter, and to the extent practical on the same
day, and subject to applicable laws, the parties shall discuss and use their
reasonable best efforts to agree as to the mandatory nature, the required
timing and the required content of such disclosure. The Required Party will
furnish only that portion of the information described in this section that
is legally required to be disclosed and will exercise its reasonable best
efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to the information described in this section so
furnished. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, each
party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof
containing information and data as to another party hereto to be returned to
the party which furnished the same, or at the other party\'s
request, destroyed.   (c) No investigation by either party of the business
and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to either party\'s obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   6.06 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. The Company
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries\' representatives not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information to, or have any discussions with, any
person relating to, any tender or exchange offer,     -36-   proposal
for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in
any manner a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the
assets or deposits of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of the foregoing,
an "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL"); PROVIDED that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company Board from (i) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, failure so
to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law;
(ii) before the date of the Company Meeting, providing (or authorizing the
provision of) information to, or engaging in (or authorizing) such
discussions or negotiations with, any person who has made a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal received after the date hereof which did not result from
a breach of this Section 6.06; or (iii) recommending such an Acquisition
Proposal to its stockholders if and only to the extent that, in the case of
actions referred to in clause (ii) or (iii), (x) such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal, (y) the Company Board, after having consulted with and
considered the advice of outside counsel to the Company Board, determines in
good faith that providing such information or engaging in such negotiations
or discussions, or making such recommendation is required in order to
discharge the directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company and its
stockholders in accordance with the DGCL and (z) the Company receives from
such person a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of
the Confidentiality Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "SUPERIOR
PROPOSAL" means any Acquisition Proposal by a third party on terms that the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the
advice of its financial advisors, to be materially more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Company and its stockholders than the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account the
likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein, taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing
terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal
and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law, after giving
the Acquiror at least two business days to respond to such third-party
Acquisition Proposal once the Board has notified the Acquiror that in the
absence of any further action by the Acquiror it would consider such
Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior Proposal, and then taking into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the Acquiror. The
Company also agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with any parties other than the Acquiror, with respect to any of
the foregoing. The Company shall promptly (within one business day) advise
the Acquiror following the receipt by it of any Acquisition Proposal and the
material terms thereof (including the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal), and advise the Acquiror of any developments
(including any change in such terms) with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal promptly upon the occurrence thereof. The Company agrees that
neither it nor any of its     -37-   Subsidiaries shall terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of or release any of its rights under
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party. The
Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
the provisions of any such agreement, including, but not limited to, by
obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court
having jurisdiction.   Nothing contained in this Section 6.06 or any other
provision of this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board
from notifying any third party that contacts the Company on an unsolicited
basis after the date hereof concerning an Acquisition Proposal of the
Company\'s obligations under this Section 6.06.   6.07 TAKEOVER LAWS. No
party shall knowingly take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from
any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect.   6.08 NO
RIGHTS TRIGGERED. The Company shall take all reasonable steps necessary to
ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or combination of
actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not
result in the grant of any rights to any person (a) under the Constitutive
Documents of the Company or (b) under any material Contract to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party except, in each case, as Previously
Disclosed or contemplated by this Agreement.   6.09 REGULATORY APPLICATIONS.

Agreement. The Acquiror and the Company will promptly file applications,
notices or other materials required to be filed with Governmental Authorities
by applicable law in connection with the Merger and promptly file any
additional information requested as soon as practicable after receipt
of request thereof; PROVIDED that each party shall duly file such

subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, the Acquiror agrees to
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each of the Acquiror and the
Company agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect
to the obtaining of all     -38-   material consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other party
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Each of the Acquiror and the Company

party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental
Authority.   6.10 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Following the Effective Time and for
a period of six years thereafter, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and
former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each,
an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, "COSTS") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (each, a "CLAIM"), to the fullest extent that the
Company is permitted to indemnify its directors and officers under applicable
law and its Constitutive Documents in effect on the date hereof (and the
Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification); PROVIDED that any determination required to be
made with respect to whether such an officer\'s or director\'s conduct
complies with the standards set forth under applicable law and the Company\'s
Constitutive Documents shall be made by independent counsel reasonably
acceptable to both the Indemnified Party and the Surviving Corporation.  
(b) For a period of four years from the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide (or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide) that portion of director\'s and officer\'s
liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers
and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) with respect to claims against such directors and officers
arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time, which
insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently
provided by the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the
Acquiror be required to expend more than twice the current amount spent by
the Company (the "INSURANCE AMOUNT") to maintain or procure such directors\'
and officers\' insurance coverage; PROVIDED,     -39-   FURTHER, that
if the Acquiror is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this Section 6.10(b), the Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount;
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that officers and directors of the Company or
any Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the Acquiror\'s insurance carrier
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.   (c) Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.10(a), upon learning of a
Claim, shall promptly notify the Acquiror thereof; PROVIDED that the failure
so to notify shall not affect the obligations of the Acquiror under Section
6.10(a) unless and to the extent that the Acquiror is actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure. In the event of a Claim (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (1) the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Acquiror shall not
be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel
or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for
the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues that raise conflicts
of interest between the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Acquiror shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless
the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest, (2) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (3) the Acquiror shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the
Acquiror shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable law.   (d) If the Acquiror or any of its
successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any
entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Acquiror shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.10.   (e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended
to benefit, and may be enforced by, all Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and representatives. An Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to be reimbursed for all expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees)
incurred in successfully enforcing this Section.      -40-    6.11
NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. (a) Each of the Company and the Acquiror
shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance
known to it that would reasonably be expected, individually or taken together

any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (2) to cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.   (b) The Company shall promptly notify the
Acquiror of any written notice or other bona fide communication from any
person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required as a
condition to the Merger.   (c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
shall, prior to the Closing Date, notify its insurers in writing of all known
incidents, events and circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to a claim against the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

agrees to permit or cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to honor all
Compensation Plans in accordance with their terms.   (b) The Company shall

situated employees of RBC Centura and its Subsidiaries and will be provided

that are generally comparable in the aggregate to those provided by RBC
Centura to similarly situated employees of RBC Centura and its
Subsidiaries.   (d) The Acquiror will cause each employee benefit plan of
RBC Centura and its Subsidiaries in which employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting thereunder, but not for purposes of benefit accrual,
the prior service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries as
if such service were with RBC Centura and its Subsidiaries, to the same
extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company.
Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be subject to any
waiting periods or pre-existing condition limitations under the medical,
dental and health plans of RBC Centura and its Subsidiaries in which they are
eligible to participate. Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will
retain credit for vacation pay which has been accrued as of the Effective
Time and for purposes of determining the entitlement     -41-   of such
employees to vacation pay following the Effective Time, the service of such
employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be treated as if
such service was with RBC Centura and its Subsidiaries.   (e) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the
Admiralty 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan effective as of the day prior to the
Closing Date, including adopting resolutions of the Company Board.   (f)

director of the Company or its Subsidiaries entitled to receive any payments
or benefits triggered by the Merger, the Company shall deliver to
the Acquiror, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Acquiror, a general
waiver and release of claims signed by such officer, employee or director.
Such release shall provide that if a termination of employment occurs during
a period in which an officer, employee or director is entitled to the
continued provision of benefits triggered by the Merger under any
Compensation and Benefit Plan (the "CIC BENEFITS CONTINUATION"), then the
Company will provide such benefits on substantially the same terms and at the
same employee costs as then in effect for the remainder of the period covered
by the CIC Benefits Continuation, and that such period shall be coincident
with the period of required coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (COBRA).   (g) The Company shall be responsible for
providing or discharging any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities
to employees and Governmental Authorities required by the Workers Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (WARN Act) or by any other applicable
law relating to plant closings or employee separations or severance pay that
are required to be provided before the Effective Time as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and RBC Centura shall be
responsible for any and all such matters following the Effective Time. The
Company shall cooperate in preparing and distributing any notices that RBC
Centura may desire to provide prior to the Effective Time, in connection with
actions by RBC Centura after the Effective Time would result in a notice
requirement under such laws.   6.13 CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. Upon the request of

or its direct or indirect subsidiaries and transfer assets or liabilities
between the Company and its Subsidiaries or between Subsidiaries; PROVIDED,

that the conditions to the obligation of the parties to consummate the Merger
will be satisfied or waived on or before the Closing Date and (2) in no event
until the day prior to the Closing Date.     -42-    6.14 CERTAIN

reasonably requested by the Acquiror to be terminated (effective prior to or
as of the Effective Time) without any penalty or other adverse consequences
to the Company or to be amended in the manner reasonably requested by the
Acquiror; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated to cause
any such Contract to be terminated unless and until the Company shall be

the Merger will be satisfied or waived on or before the Closing Date.

are cumulative with, and not intended to limit, other remedies that may be
available, and that, without these agreements, the Acquiror would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Acquiror commences a suit which results in a judgment
