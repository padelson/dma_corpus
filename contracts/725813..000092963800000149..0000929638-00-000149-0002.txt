                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 25,
2000, by and among Norton Company, a Massachusetts corporation ("Purchaser"),
PPLC Acquisition, Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Purchaser ("Merger Sub"), and Chemfab Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company").

     WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company
deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its
respective stockholders that Purchaser and the Company combine in order to
advance the long-term business interests of Purchaser and the Company;

     WHEREAS, the combination of Purchaser and the Company shall be effected by
the terms of this Agreement through a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par
value $0.10 per share ("Company Common Stock") for $18.25 per share of Company
Common Stock, net to stockholders of the Company in cash, without interest, or
such higher price as may be paid in the Offer (the "Merger Consideration"), on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, which
Offer, if completed in accordance with its terms, shall be followed promptly
thereafter by the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the
Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser;

     WHEREAS, in order to induce Purchaser and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, Purchaser,
Merger Sub and certain directors or executive officers of the Company are
entering into an agreement (the "Shareholders Agreement"), pursuant to which
each of such individuals has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof, to tender his or her shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of the Offer and to vote his or her shares of Company Common Stock in
favor of the Merger and other matters necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

     WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and to prescribe
certain conditions to the Offer and the Merger;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:


<PAGE>

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE OFFER

     1.01. The Offer.

     (a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred that, had the Offer been
commenced, would result in a failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth
in Annex I hereto (other than the conditions described in Paragraphs (i), (ii)
and (iii) of Annex I), as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in
no event later than seven (7) business days following the public announcement
of the terms of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Purchaser shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence the Offer at a price of $18.25 per share of Company
Common Stock, net to the stockholders of the Company in cash (the "Offer
Price"). The Offer shall be subject only to (i) the condition that there shall
be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the
expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn, a number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned
by Purchaser and/or Merger Sub, represents at least a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the "Minimum
Condition"), and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto
(collectively with the Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions"). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions and to make
any change in the terms or Offer Conditions, provided that, no change or waiver
may be made that, without the prior written consent of the Company, waives or
changes the Offer Conditions described in Paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv)(a) or (h)
of Annex I hereto, changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer,
decreases the Offer Price or the number of shares of Company Common Stock
sought in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set
forth in Annex I hereto or is otherwise materially adverse to the stockholders
of the Company.

     (b) Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company,

     (A) extend the Offer, if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of
the Offer, any of the Offer Conditions shall have not been satisfied or waived,
until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, for one or more
periods of not more than ten (10) business days each, but in no event ending
later than October 31, 2000 (the "Latest Expiration Date"); provided, that, if
at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, any of the Offer
Conditions set forth in Paragraph (ii) of Annex I hereto shall not have been
satisfied as of such date, then, at the Company's request, Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived,
for one or more periods of not more than ten (10) business days each, but in no
event ending later than the Latest Expiration Date; provided, further, however,
that, notwithstanding this clause (A), if, at the scheduled expiration date of
the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived
other than the Minimum Condition (other than a condition under Paragraphs
(iv)(e) or (f) of Annex I under circumstances where the Company is entitled to
cause an extension pursuant to the next proviso), Merger Sub may extend (and

<PAGE>

shall extend, if requested by the Company) the Offer beyond such scheduled
expiration date for only one period of not more than twenty (20) business days
from such date, in the event of an extension by Purchaser, and not more than
ten (10) calendar days from such date, in the event of an extension requested
by the Company; provided, further, however, that notwithstanding this clause
(A), if, at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, all of the Offer
Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived (other than the Minimum
Condition in circumstances where the Company is entitled to cause an extension
pursuant to the preceding proviso) other than the conditions set forth in
Paragraphs (iv)(e) and/or (f) of Annex I and the cure periods set forth in
Paragraphs (iv)(e) or (f) of Annex I shall have not expired, at the request of
the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for the remainder of the
applicable cure period, but not beyond the Latest Expiration Date;

     (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or its staff applicable to the Offer or any period required by
applicable law;

     (C) extend the Offer on one occasion for an aggregate period of not more
than ten (10) business days beyond the latest expiration date described in
clause (A) or clause (B) of this Section 1.01(b), if on such expiration date
all of the conditions to the Offer, including the Minimum Condition, are
satisfied or waived but the number of shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn is less than 90% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis; and

     (D) extend the Offer beyond the latest expiration date, if on such
expiration date, all of the conditions to the Offer, including the Minimum
Condition, are satisfied or waived, to include a "subsequent offering period"
as such term is defined in Rule 14d-11 of the rules and regulations of the SEC;
provided, that Merger Sub shall not be permitted to extend the Offer pursuant
to this clause (D) unless Merger Sub shall, and Purchaser shall cause it to,
first accept and promptly pay for all shares of Company Common Stock tendered
prior to the expiration of the initial offering period, as it may have been
previously extended in accordance with this Section 1.01(b), and shall
otherwise meet the requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act in
connection with each such extension; provided further, that Merger Sub may not,
without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer pursuant to this clause
(D) for more than fifteen (15) business days from the expiration of the initial
offering period as it may have been previously extended pursuant to this clause
(D).

     Upon the prior satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the Offer,
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub will, and
Purchaser will cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, purchase and pay for,
in accordance with the terms of the Offer, all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as promptly as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer. Purchaser shall provide or cause
to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for

<PAGE>

any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept
for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer. Following the purchase of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Purchaser, Merger Sub and
the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon thereafter as possible.

     (c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Purchaser and Merger Sub
shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the "Schedule
TO") with respect to the Offer (such Schedule TO and such documents included
therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Offer Documents shall comply
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
(as defined herein) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and
the Offer Documents, on the date first published, sent or given to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Purchaser, Merger Sub
and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. Purchaser and Merger
Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as, and
to the extent, required, by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and
its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC or disseminated to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Merger Sub shall provide the Company
and its counsel any comments Purchaser, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
the receipt of such comments.

     1.02. Company Action.

     (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer, but only to the extent the
Offer is made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In
connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to
furnish Purchaser promptly with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock (including
non-objecting beneficial owners who are not record holders) as of a recent date
and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together
with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and
computer files and all other information in Company's possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of shares of Company Common Stock, and shall
furnish to Purchaser such information and assistance (including updated lists
of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Merger Sub
may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Purchaser, Merger Sub and

<PAGE>

each of their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any
such labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection
with the Offer and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver, and
will use their best efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company
all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or control.

     (b) On the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with
the SEC and disseminate to holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, assuming that
the Offer is made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and, subject to Sections 6.06 and 6.08, shall reflect the
recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors referred to in Section 4.18.
The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published,
sent or given to the holders of Company Common Stock, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if, and to the extent
that, it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The
Company agrees to take all the steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Company Common Stock, in each case as, and to the extent required by,
applicable federal securities laws. Purchaser and its counsel shall be given an
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being
filed with the SEC. The Company shall provide Purchaser and its counsel any
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments.

     1.03. Directors.

     (a) Promptly following the purchase of, and payment for, a number of
shares of Company Common Stock that satisfies the Minimum Condition, Purchaser
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Company's Board of Directors that equals the product of
the total number of directors on the Company's Board of Directors (giving
effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section)
and the percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by Purchaser and/or Merger Sub (including shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment and paid for) bears to the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall take all
action necessary to cause Purchaser's designees to be appointed to the

<PAGE>

Company's Board of Directors, including increasing the number of directors, and
seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the
Company will also use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals
designated by Purchaser to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Board and (ii) each board of
directors of each Company subsidiary (and each committee thereof) that
represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of
Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
Purchaser's designees are to be appointed or elected to the Company's Board of
Directors, until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that such Board of Directors shall have at least three
directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement, two of whom shall be
non-employee directors of the Company and one of whom shall be the current
president and chief executive officer of the Company (the "Continuing
Directors"); provided that in the event that the number of Continuing Directors
shall be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, any remaining
Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if there shall be only one
remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who
shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

     (b) The Company's obligations to appoint Purchaser's designees to the
Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions,
and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require
in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section. Purchaser shall supply
to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

     (c) Following the election or appointment of Purchaser's designees
pursuant to Section 1.03(a) hereof and until the Effective Time, the approval
of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and
such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors
and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination
of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring
action by the Board of Directors, any amendment of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, any extension of time for performance
of any obligation or action hereunder by Purchaser or Merger Sub, or any waiver
of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the
benefit of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE MERGER

     2.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein, and
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. The Merger shall
occur at the Effective Time (as defined herein). Following the Merger, the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes referred herein

<PAGE>

as the "Surviving Corporation") and Merger Sub shall cease to exist as a
separate corporation.

     2.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on a date to be specified by Purchaser and the
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth business
day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles VII,
VIII and IX (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing), at
the offices of Bingham Dana LLP, 150 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts,
unless another date, place or time is agreed to by Purchaser and the Company.

     2.03. Effective Time. At the Closing, the parties shall cause a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with respect to the Merger
to be filed and recorded in accordance with the DGCL, and shall take all such
further actions as may be required by law to make the Merger effective. The
Merger shall be effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or
at such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective
Time"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Sections 259, 260 and

Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed as provided therein or by applicable law; provided,

                                  ARTICLE III

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     3.01. Conversion of Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or Merger
Sub:

          (a) Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser or any of
its subsidiaries or by the Company or by any Company Subsidiary (as defined

<PAGE>

in Section 4.04(a)) shall be cancelled and extinguished and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

          (b) Each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
3.03) and shares held by Purchaser of any of its subsidiaries or by the Company
or by any Company Subsidiary), shall be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into and become the right to receive in cash from
Purchaser an amount equal to the Merger Consideration.

          (c) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and each certificate (each a "Certificate") previously
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
Section 3.05 hereof, without any interest thereon.

          (d) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

     3.02. Company Options.

          (a) At the Effective Time, each option (each, an "Option") to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to employee or other stock
option plans of the Company (the "Company Stock Option Plans"), which has not
otherwise been exercised, shall become 100% vested and immediately exercisable.
Each holder of such an Option outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive in full satisfaction of such Option, and Purchaser shall
cause to be mailed to each such holder, promptly following the Closing Date,
and, in any event, within five (5) business days thereafter, a cash payment in
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Option, multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide written notice of the terms of this Section 3.02 to each
holder of an Option.

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including, if appropriate, amending the terms of any option plan or
arrangement or obtaining optionee consents) that are necessary to give effect
to the transactions contemplated by Section 3.02(a) hereof.

<PAGE>

     3.03. Dissenting Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock that,
immediately before the Effective Time, was held by any person who has duly
exercised the appraisal rights afforded to dissenting stockholders pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and who, after the Effective Time, perfects and does
not withdraw its right to appraisal (such shares, collectively, "Dissenting
Shares") will be converted into the right to receive the fair value of such
shares as determined in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL. The Company
shall give Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands. If Purchaser and Merger Sub are
not required by the DGCL to obtain the approval of the other stockholders of
the Company in order to effectuate the Merger and can effect the Merger without
holding a meeting of such stockholders, Purchaser and Merger Sub will effect
the Merger and, promptly thereafter, will provide notice to the stockholders of
the Company, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL, that the Merger has become
effective and that such stockholders are entitled to exercise their dissenters'
rights in accordance with the DGCL.

     3.04. Purchaser to Deposit Aggregate Merger Consideration As needed,
Purchaser shall pay to a bank or trust company selected by Purchaser and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article III,
such amount of cash as is sufficient from time to time to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration which holders of Company Common Stock are entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.01(b) hereof and the amounts to be paid to
holders of unexercised options under Company Stock Option Plans pursuant to
Section 3.02 hereof. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.04 that remains unclaimed by
holders of Company Common Stock eighteen months after the Effective Time shall
be returned to Purchaser, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged such shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Agreement shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser
for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon; provided, however, that from and after the date which is
forty-eight months after the Effective Time, any portion of the Merger
Consideration that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Purchaser
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for
which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Purchaser upon
demand.

     3.05. Exchange of Shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a

<PAGE>

form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a person or entity other than the person or
entity in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person or
entity requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other taxes required as a result of such payment to a person or entity other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

     3.06. No Transfers. After the Effective Time, no transfers of shares of
the Company Common Stock will be made in the stock transfer books of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented (for
transfer or otherwise) to the Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent or
the Exchange Agent, such Certificates will be canceled and exchanged in
accordance with Section 3.05.

     3.07. No Liability. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash payments delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable escheat, abandoned property or similar law.

     3.08. Lost Certificates. In the event that any Certificate has been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, then upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to the
ownership, loss, theft, or destruction of such Certificate and of a customary
indemnification agreement, Purchaser or its transfer agent or the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for the lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the record holder of any such Certificate representing Dissenting
Shares shall instead retain the right to receive the fair value of such shares
as determined in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL.

     3.09. Other Funding. Prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
enter into arrangements for the timely payment of the indebtedness and other
amounts set forth in Section 3.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (as
defined in Article 4). In addition, prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser
shall make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Company for the payment
on the Closing Date of the fees and expenses of Tanner & Co., Inc. and all
payments required to be made by the Company and described in Section 3.09 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

<PAGE>

     3.10. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

     3.11. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment, or
stock dividend with a record date during such period, but excluding any change
resulting from the issuance of shares upon exercise of Options, warrants or
other rights to acquire Company Common Stock outstanding on the date of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms, the cash payable pursuant to the
Offer, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

     3.12. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any person or entity pursuant to this Article such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Options in respect
of which the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except as set forth in the SEC Filings (as defined in Section 4.05 below)
or on the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Purchaser on the date

and each Company Subsidiary is qualified or otherwise authorized to transact
business as a foreign corporation or other organization in all jurisdictions in
which such qualification or authorization is required by law, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or authorized would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined

          (b) The Company has previously made available to Purchaser true and
complete copies of the charter and bylaws or other organizational documents of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in default in
any material respect in the performance, observation or fulfillment of such
documents.

          (c) For purposes of this Agreement a "Company Material Adverse
Effect" means a material adverse effect on the assets, properties, business,

generally accepted accounting principles, (vi) changes in general economic

delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Company. No other action on the part of the Company or its stockholders is
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than

shares of Company Common Stock). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company.

     4.03. Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists

such additional Taxes as are being contested in good faith and which if
determined adversely to the Seller Companies would not be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No deficiency in Taxes or other
proposed adjustment that has not been settled or otherwise resolved has been

is now under examination by any applicable taxing authority. There are no
material liens for Taxes (other than current Taxes not yet due and payable) on
any of the assets of any Seller Company, except for such liens for Taxes which
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

threatened, legal action, proceeding, or investigation, other than routine
claims for benefits, concerning any Employee Benefit Plan, or to the Company's

increases in the amount of any benefit payable to or in respect of any such

the aggregate Merger Consideration and to perform Purchaser's other obligations
hereunder is not contingent on Purchaser or any of its affiliates' raising any
equity capital, obtaining specific financing thereof, or obtaining the consent
of any lender.

     5.07. Purchaser Net Worth. As of the date hereof, the total net worth of
Purchaser is, and until the Effective Time, the total net worth of Purchaser

delivered to the Company a certificate to the foregoing effect executed by the
treasurer of Purchaser.

     5.08. Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Purchaser, at a meeting

          (a) The information relating to Purchaser and its subsidiaries to be
contained in the Company Proxy Statement, the Schedule 14D9, and any other

<PAGE>

documents filed with the SEC or any regulatory agency in connection herewith,
to the extent such information is provided in writing by Purchaser, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,

time such stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement, and (ii) in the case
of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D9 or any amendments or supplements
thereto or any other document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
or required to be distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company's
stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
other than the Company Proxy Statement, at the time of the filing of such
document or any supplement or amendment thereto and at the time of any
distribution or dissemination thereof.

          (b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with
respect to Purchaser, its officers and directors or any of its subsidiaries
should occur which is required to be described in an amendment or a supplement
to, (i) the Company Proxy Statement or the Schedule 14D9, Purchaser shall
promptly so advise the Company and provide to the Company such information as
necessary to allow the Company to prepare such amendment or supplement or (ii)
the Offer Documents, such amendment or supplement (which the Company shall have
a reasonable opportunity to review) shall be promptly filed with the SEC and,

operations of the Company, as is reasonably necessary or appropriate in
connection with Purchaser's investigation of the Company with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any such investigation and examination shall
be conducted at reasonable times and under reasonable circumstances so as to
minimize any disruption to or impairment of the Company's business and the
Company shall cooperate fully therein. No investigation by Purchaser shall
diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement. In order that Purchaser

consultants, agents, accountants and attorneys to cooperate fully with such
representatives in connection with such investigation.

     6.03. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.03 hereof,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Purchaser shall bear their
respective expenses incurred by each in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions

agents, representatives, counsel, accountants, brokers, financial advisors and
investment bankers.

     6.04. Third-Party Consents. The parties shall use their reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents and Permits of
others, necessary or desirable in connection with the consummation of the Offer
and the Merger.

     6.05. Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall execute such
documents, further instruments of transfer and assignment and other papers and
take such further actions as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry
out the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party

actions to ensure that, to the extent within its control or capable of

carried out in a timely fashion.

     6.06. Company Stockholders Meeting.

          (a) The Company will (i) as promptly as practicable after the
consummation of the Offer, take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders

and for such other purposes as may be, in the Company's reasonable judgment,
necessary or desirable, unless the DGCL does not require a vote of the
Company's stockholders for consummation of the Merger, (ii) subject to Section
6.06(b), recommend to its stockholders the approval of the aforementioned
matters to be submitted by it to its stockholders, and (iii) cooperate and
consult with Purchaser with respect to each of the foregoing matters.

withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Purchaser, its approval and
recommendation to its stockholders referred to in Sections 4.18 and 6.06(a)
hereof, but only if (i) the Company has complied in all respects with the terms
of Section 6.08, including without limitation, the requirement that it notify
Purchaser promptly after its receipt of any proposal for, or a proposal
reasonably likely to lead to, an Alternative Transaction (as defined in Section
6.08); it being understood by the parties hereto that a de minimis breach by
the Company of the terms of Section 6.08 shall not be deemed to constitute a
breach of Section 6.08 for purposes of this Section 6.06(b)(i), (ii) a Superior

<PAGE>

Proposal (as defined in Section 6.08) has been made at the time the Company's
Board of Directors determines to take any such action, (iii) the Company's
Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after receipt
of the advice of its outside legal counsel, that consistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, it must take such action; and (iv) the Company
shall have delivered to Purchaser four business days prior written notice
advising Purchaser that it intends to take such action.

          (c) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall

reasonable efforts to have the Company Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC.
Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of
the Company Proxy Statement and the Company shall notify the Purchaser promptly
of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Purchaser promptly
copies of all correspondence between the Company or any representative of the
Company and the SEC. The Company shall give Purchaser and its counsel the
opportunity to review the Company Proxy Statement prior to its being filed with
the SEC and shall give Purchaser and its counsel the opportunity to review all
amendments and supplements to the Company Proxy Statement and all responses to
requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their
being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Purchaser and the Company
agrees to use all reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other party
hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and
to cause the Company Proxy Statement and all required amendments and
supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of the Company Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting referred to in Section
6.06(a) hereof at the earliest practicable time.

          (d) Purchaser and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable in connection with the Company Proxy Statement or, subject to
Section 6.09, any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries to
any governmental authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     6.07. Public Announcements. Purchaser and the Company will consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement and will not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party, issue such press release, file with the SEC a Current Report on
Form 8-K, or make such public statement as may upon the advice of counsel be
required by law or the rules and regulations of the SEC or any applicable

<PAGE>

securities exchange, if such party has first used reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party.

     6.08. No Solicitation. The Company will not, and will not permit any of
its directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives (including
any financial advisors or attorneys) or those of any Company Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly:

          (a) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage discussions with any
Person, other than Purchaser, relating to the possible acquisition of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or of all or a material portion of the assets
or capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any merger,
reorganization, consolidation, business combination, share exchange,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any tender offer or exchange offer for
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in
connection therewith (an "Alternative Transaction"); or

          (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
non-public information relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to, or cooperate with respect to any of the foregoing with, any
Person that the Company has reason to believe may be considering making or that
has made, a proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative
Transaction; or

          (c) recommend or propose to publicly recommend, the approval or
adoption of any Alternative Transaction (other than any Alternative Transaction
involving Purchaser); or

          (d) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Board of Directors of
the Company shall be permitted:

               (i) to the extent applicable, to comply with Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act with regard to an Alternative Transaction; and

               (ii) to engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or to
provide any information to, a Person who makes an unsolicited bona fide written
proposal for an Alternative Transaction involving 50% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, with terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment by a majority
vote, after receipt of the advice of Tanner & Co., Inc. or another financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account all the
terms and conditions of the Alternative Transaction, including any break-up

<PAGE>

fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are more
favorable in the aggregate and provide greater value to the Company's
stockholders than as provided hereunder, if, and only to the extent that, in
the case of the actions referred to in this clause (ii), (A) the Company is not
in breach of its obligations under this Section 6.08; it being understood by
the parties hereto that a de minimis breach by the Company of the terms of this
Section 6.08 shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 6.08
for purposes of this clause (A), (B) the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith by majority vote, after receipt of the advice of its
outside legal counsel, that the provision of such information or the engaging
in such negotiations or discussions is required by the directors' fiduciary
duties in accordance with Delaware law, (C) prior to providing any information
or data to any Person in connection with an Alternative Transaction, the Board
of Directors of the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (D) the Company shall have
delivered to Purchaser four business days' prior written notice advising
Purchaser that it intends to take such action, and (E) the Offer shall not have
closed. Any proposal described above in this clause (ii) in connection with
which the conditions referred to in the preceding clauses (A) through (E) have
been satisfied is referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal."

     The Company shall notify Purchaser promptly (and, in any case, within
twenty-four hours) of any inquiries, proposals or offers received from any
third party who the Company has reason to believe may be considering making, or
has made, a proposal for any Alternative Transaction, any information requested
by such third party, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated
or continued by such third party, indicating, in connection with such notice,
the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals
or offers. The Company agrees that it will keep Purchaser fully informed, on a
current basis (and, in any case, within twentyfour hours), of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any proposed Alternative
Transaction or similar transaction or arrangement and will not waive any rights
under any confidentiality agreements entered into with such parties and shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause any such party (or its agents or advisors)
in possession of confidential information about the Company that was furnished
by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such information.

     6.09. HSR Act and Other Filings.

          (a) The Purchaser and the Company shall (a) as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, with each of the Purchaser and the Company
using their commercially reasonable efforts to make a prompt filing, make such
filings as may be required by the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) respond promptly to inquiries from the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in connection with such filings, (c)

<PAGE>

file or cause to be filed as promptly as practicable with the Department of
Justice and Federal Trade Commission any supplemental information that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act, and (d) seek the earliest possible
termination or waiver of the waiting period under such statute. The Purchaser
and the Company shall as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, with
each of the Purchaser and the Company using their commercially reasonable
efforts to make prompt filings, also file or cause the filing of the notices,
applications, and requests pursuant to any other Antitrust Law, including
filings with federal, state and local governmental authorities described in
Schedule 6.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

          (b) Each of the Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
Law (as defined below). If any administrative, judicial or legislative action
or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law,
the Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, by pursuing all reasonable avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal. The commercially reasonable efforts on the part of the
Purchaser will include complying with any request to sell or otherwise dispose
of, or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise)
particular assets or categories of assets, or businesses of the Purchaser or
the Company or any of their affiliates or withdraw from doing business in a
particular jurisdiction or take any other action requested; provided, that any
such request or action would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Purchaser,
reasonably be expected to result in, directly or indirectly, a reduction in
aggregate revenues (based on revenues of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and its
affiliates or the Company, as the case may be, for fiscal 2000) of Compagnie de
Saint-Gobain and its affiliates (including the Company) on an annualized basis
in excess of $12,500,000 (any such request or action hereinafter referred to as
a "Burdensome Regulatory Condition").

          (c) Each of the Purchaser and the Company shall promptly inform each
other of any material communication made to, or received by such party from,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or any other federal, state or foreign governmental or regulatory
authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event of a Burdensome Regulatory Condition, nothing in this
Section 6.09 shall (i) limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.01 so long as such party has up to then complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.09, which for

<PAGE>

purposes of this Section 6.09(d) shall require that Purchaser also use its
reasonable best efforts for a reasonable period of time to lift or remove a
Burdensome Regulatory Condition, or (ii) require Purchaser, its affiliates or
the Company to consent to any restriction, limitation obligation or other
action with respect to the businesses of Purchaser, its affiliates or the
Company or any sale or disposition of any assets of Purchaser, its affiliates
or the Company, if such restriction, limitation, obligation or other action
would constitute a Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

          (e) "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
all other federal and state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines, and other laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade.

     6.10. Notification of Certain Matters. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the Company shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event or circumstance the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would be likely to cause (i) any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement that is qualified by a reference to a Company Material Adverse
Effect or otherwise contains a materiality qualifier to be untrue or inaccurate
or (ii) any representation or warranty in this Agreement that is not so
qualified to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect and (b) any
material failure of the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder.

     6.11. Employee Matters.

          (a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary thereof, Purchaser agrees to provide the employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") who remain
employed after the Effective Time (collectively, the "Transferred Company
Employees") with benefits and compensation (other than stock and stock-based
compensation and the value thereof) substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the benefits and compensation provided to such employees by the Company
prior to the Effective Time. Purchaser will treat, and cause its benefit plans
to treat, the service of the Company Employees with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as service rendered to Purchaser for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits including, but not
limited to, applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but not
for benefit accrual (including minimum pension amount) attributable to any
period before the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser
shall not treat any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries as a
"new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health or similar plan
of Purchaser for a pre-existing medical condition, and will make appropriate
arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result.

<PAGE>

          (b) Compensation Arrangements. Following the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall honor and shall cause its subsidiaries to honor (i) in
accordance with their terms, all individual employment, termination, severance,
transaction bonus, change in control, post-employment and other compensation
agreements, arrangements and plans existing prior to the execution of this
Agreement and referred to in Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
which are between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any director,
officer or employee thereof, and (ii) all legally imposed obligations relating
to employment matters pursuant to applicable law, and Purchaser will not, and
will not cause any of its subsidiaries to, challenge the validity of any
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any employment,
consulting, supplemental retirement or other compensation, contract or
arrangement with any current or former director, officer or employee of the
Company.

          (c) Continuation of Plans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Purchaser shall have sole discretion with respect to the

purposes of this Section 10.01(b)(iii), (B) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Purchaser its

legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in any judgment or
settlement against the Company for such amount. If, in such legal action, the
Company is the prevailing party, Purchaser shall pay the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such legal action.

alters or changes the amount or kind of consideration to be received as
provided in Section 3.01, (b) alters or changes any term of the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to be effected by the Merger, if
any, or (c) alters or changes any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
if such alteration or change would adversely affect the stockholders of the
Company.

     10.05. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other party or any conditions to its own obligations, in each
case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are

intended for its benefit; provided that any such extension or waiver shall be
binding upon a party only if such extension or waiver is set forth in a writing
executed by such party. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser and Merger
Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, subject to Section 1.01(b)
of the Merger Agreement, and may terminate the Offer, if:

     (i)    the Minimum Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has not
            been satisfied or waived (pursuant to the Merger Agreement) by the
            scheduled expiration date;

     (ii)   the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
            applicable Antitrust Law (as indicated in Section 7.03 of the
            Company Disclosure Schedule) shall not have expired or been
            terminated by the expiration date of the Offer, or the approvals
            listed in Section 7.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule have not
            been obtained;

     (iii)  the Company has not delivered to the Purchaser the certification
            described in Section 6.14 of the Merger Agreement;

     (iv)   at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior
            to the expiration date of the Offer, any of the following
            conditions exist:

            (a)  there shall be any law or regulation that makes acceptance for
                 payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock
                 pursuant to the Offer illegal or otherwise prohibited or any
                 judgment, injunction, order or decree of any court or
                 governmental entity having competent jurisdiction enjoining
                 Merger Sub from accepting for payment of, and paying for, the
                 shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and such
                 judgment, injunction, order or decree shall have become final
                 and nonappealable; or

            (b)  there shall have occurred any event that has had or would
                 reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
                 aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

            (c)  any person shall have entered into a definitive agreement or
                 an agreement in principle with the Company regarding an
                 Alternative Transaction; or

            (d)  the Board of Directors of the Company (1) shall have
                 withdrawn, or modified in a manner adverse to Purchaser, its
                 approval or recommendation of the Merger Agreement, the Offer

<PAGE>

                 or the Merger, (2) shall have failed to reaffirm such approval
                 or recommendation upon Purchaser's request or (3) shall have
                 recommended, or publicly announced its intention to enter
                 into, a definitive agreement or an agreement in principle with
                 respect to an Alternative Transaction; or

            (e)  provided that Purchaser or Merger Sub is not then in material
                 breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
                 agreement contained in the Merger Agreement, the Company shall
                 have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
                 obligation or to comply in any material respect with any
                 agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or
                 complied with by it under the Merger Agreement, and, for
                 purposes of determining whether or not Purchaser is entitled
                 to terminate the Offer, such breach is either not cured within
                 twenty (20) days following written notice to the Company or by
                 its nature cannot be cured; or

            (f)  any representations and warranties of the Company contained in
                 the Merger Agreement that are qualified by materiality or
                 Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct
                 or any such representations and warranties that are not so
                 qualified shall not be true and correct in all material
                 respects, in each case, when made or as of the scheduled
                 expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time
                 (except as to any representation or warranty in the Merger
                 Agreement which specifically relates to an earlier date or
                 period, which only must have been true and correct (subject to
                 materiality as provided above) as of such date or period),
                 and, for purposes of determining whether or not Purchaser is
                 entitled to terminate the Offer, such failure to be true and
                 correct is either not cured within twenty (20) days following
                 written notice to the Company or by its nature cannot be
                 cured; or

            (g)  the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
                 with its terms.

            (h)  There shall be instituted or pending any action, investigation
                 or proceeding by any government or governmental authority or
                 agency, domestic or foreign, before any court or governmental
                 authority or agency, domestic or foreign,

<PAGE>

                       (1) challenging the acquisition by Purchaser or Merger
                 Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock under the Offer,
                 seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of
                 the Offer or the Merger or the performance of any of the other
                 transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or seeking
                 to require the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub to pay any
                 damages related to the Offer, the Merger or the other
                 transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that are
                 material in relation to the Company taken as a whole,

                       (2) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of
                 Merger Sub, or to render Merger Sub unable to accept for
                 payment, pay for or purchase some or all of the shares of
                 Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger,

                       (3) seeking to impose or require a Burdensome Regulatory
                 Condition,

            (i)  it shall have been publicly disclosed or Purchaser shall have
                 otherwise learned that any person or "group" (as defined in
                 Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than Purchaser or
                 any of its affiliates, shall have acquired beneficial
                 ownership of more than 30% of any class or series of capital
                 stock of the Company (including the shares of Company Common
                 Stock), through the acquisition of stock, the formation of a
                 group or otherwise, or shall have been granted any option,
                 right or warrant, conditional or otherwise, to acquire
                 beneficial ownership of more than 30% of any class or series
                 of capital stock of the Company (including the shares of
                 Company Common Stock);

     which, without in any way limiting or adding to such conditions, in the
sole judgment of Purchaser, makes it inadvisable to proceed with such
acceptance for payment or payment.

     Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. The foregoing conditions
are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Merger Sub and may, subject to the
terms of Section 1.01(a) of the Merger Agreement, be waived by Purchaser and
Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their
discretion. The failure by Purchaser or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any
of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the
waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances
shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances,

<PAGE>

and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at
any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time.
