iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 14, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among Shiseido Company, Limited, a Japanese corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Blush Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and an
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Bare
Escentuals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms
used in this Agreement are used as defined in _Section 9.12_.

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
shareholders and stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that Merger Sub
shall make a cash tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the issued
and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company (" _Shares_ ") for $18.20 per Share (such amount, or any greater
amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the " _Per Share Amount_
"), net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and the Offer;

WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the parties intend that,
following the consummation of the Offer and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving that merger (the " _Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) resolved by unanimous
vote of those voting to recommend that holders of Shares tender their Shares
pursuant to the Offer and, if required by applicable law, adopt this
Agreement, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and
(iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, to enter into this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into a Stockholder Support
Agreement with Berkshire Fund V, Limited Partnership, Berkshire Fund VI,
Limited Partnership, Berkshire Investors LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC
concerning their Shares (the " _Stockholder Support Agreement_ ");

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into new Employment Agreements with each of
Leslie Blodgett and Myles McCormick (the " _New Employment Agreements_ "),
which will become effective immediately upon Merger Subs purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer; WHEREAS, Parent and Leslie Blodgett have entered into a Contribution Agreement
(the " _LB Contribution Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, immediately
following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer, Leslie
Blodgett will contribute the Shares owned by her to a wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of Parent in exchange for (i) cash in the Per Share Amount for a
portion of her Shares and (ii) an indirect interest in the Company for the
remainder of her Shares; and

WHEREAS, the Company and Leslie Blodgett have entered into an Amended and
Restated Name and Likeness License Agreement (the " _License Agreement_ "
and, together with the Stockholder Support Agreement, the New Employment
Agreements and the LB Contribution Agreement, the " _Ancillary Agreements_ "),
which will become effective immediately upon Merger Subs purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

_THE OFFER_

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_ and that none of the events set forth in clauses (a)
through (i) of _Annex A_  hereto shall have occurred or be continuing, Merger
Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event
later than ten business days after the date of this Agreement. The obligation
of Merger Sub to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
shall be subject only to (i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that
at least the number of Shares that shall constitute a majority of the then
outstanding Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis shall have been validly tendered
and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer and (ii) the
satisfaction of each of the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto.
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any such condition, to
increase the price per Share payable in the Offer, and to make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, without the prior written consent of the Company, (y) the
Minimum Condition may not be waived and (z) no change may be made that (A)
decreases the price per Share payable in the Offer, (B) changes the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (C) reduces the maximum number of Shares
to be purchased in the Offer, (D) amends any term of the Offer in any manner
adverse to holders of the Shares, (E) imposes conditions to the Offer not set
forth in _Annex A_ hereto or amends any of the conditions to the Offer set
forth in _Annex A_ hereto in any manner adverse to any holder of Shares or (F)
except as otherwise provided in this _Section 1.1(a)_, extends the term of
the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may (i) extend the Offer
for one or more periods of not more than 10 business days each beyond the
scheduled expiration date, which initially shall be 30 business days
following the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "),
if, at the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent scheduled expiration of
the Offer, any of the conditions to 



 

2  Merger Subs obligation to accept for payment Shares shall not be satisfied
or waived or (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation or interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ "), or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer. The Per Share Amount
shall, subject to applicable withholding of taxes, be net to the seller in
cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. Merger Sub
shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly following
the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the
SEC and the terms and conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub expressly reserves
the right to delay payment for Shares in order to comply in whole or in part
with applicable Laws. Any such delay shall be effected in compliance with
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Merger Sub may extend the Offer after
the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a further period of time by means of a
subsequent offering period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange
Act to meet the objective that there be validly tendered, in accordance with
the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration of the Offer (as so extended),
and not withdrawn, a number of Shares which, together with Shares then owned
by Parent and Merger Sub, represents at least 90% of the then outstanding
Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis. If the payment equal to the Per Share Amount
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer
books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate
so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Amount to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub that
such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. The Company agrees
that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
tendered in the Offer.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_
") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")
and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any related summary
advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other
documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall take all actions necessary to cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub
further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents prior to such documents being filed with
the SEC or disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written comments or
telephonic notification of any oral comments that Parent, Merger Sub or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, shall consult with 



 

3  the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and
shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses
thereto and telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto by Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel. Parent and Merger Sub agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to the SEC or its staff with
respect any comments received from them relating to the Offer Documents. 

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any and all Shares that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(d) Upon the expiration of the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable, all Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

Section 1.2. _Company Action_.

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents
that the Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held
on January 14, 2010, has, by unanimous vote of those voting, (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including each of the Offer and the Merger (collectively, the " _Transactions_
"), are in the best interests of the holders of Shares, (ii) approved,
adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions (such
approval and adoption having been made in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), including, without
limitation, Section 203 thereof) and (iii) resolved to recommend that the
holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer and adopt this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the Company described in this _Section 1.2(a)_
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), and the Company shall not withdraw
or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to Merger Sub or Parent
except as set forth in _Section 6.5(c)_. The Company has been advised by its
directors and executive officers other than Leslie Blodgett, whose Shares are
subject to the LB Contribution Agreement, that they intend to tender all
outstanding Shares owned by them to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer other
than Shares (y) held by any such executive officer or director who has
purchased or sold any Shares, or exercised any Option or Company Award,
during the six-month period preceding the date hereof or (z) acquired by any
such executive officer or director more than ten months, but less than twelve
months, prior to the date of this Agreement. 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing the Fairness Opinion (as defined
below), subject to consent to such inclusion by Goldman, Sachs and Co., and,
except as provided in _Section 6.5(c)_, the Company Board Recommendation, and
shall take all steps necessary to disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and any other applicable U.S. federal securities Laws.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, 



 

4  and Parent shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent, Merger Sub and Parents Affiliates that may
be required by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The Company
shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to such document being filed with the SEC
or disseminated to holders of Shares. The Company shall provide Parent and
its counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of
any oral comments that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of
such comments, shall consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding
to any such comments, and shall provide Parent and its counsel with a copy of
any written responses thereto and telephonic notification of any oral
responses thereto of the Company or its counsel.

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall promptly
furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings
of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with
all other available listings and computer files in the Companys possession or
control containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall promptly furnish
Parent and Merger Sub with such additional information in the Companys
possession or control, including, without limitation, updated listings and
computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings,
and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of
Shares, as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial owners of the Shares.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall
hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions,
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_,
shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession.

Section 1.3. _Top Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top
Up Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section 1.3_, to purchase, for consideration per Top Up Option Share equal
to the Per Share Amount, up to that number of newly issued Shares (the " _Top
Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of (i) the number of Shares that,
when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately
following the consummation of the Offer and the contribution of Shares
pursuant to the LB Contribution Agreement, shall constitute one share more
than 90% of the Shares then outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares) and (ii) the aggregate
number of Shares held as treasury shares by the Company and the number
of Shares that the Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of
incorporation



 

5 but which (A) are not issued and outstanding, (B) are not reserved for
issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and (C) are issuable without the
approval of the Companys stockholders.

(b) In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top Up Option, Parent
shall give the Company three business days prior written notice specifying
the number of Shares that are owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately
following consummation of the Offer and the contribution of Shares pursuant
to the LB Contribution Agreement and specifying a place and a time for the
closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following
receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying the
number of Top Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top Up
Option Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall pay to the Company an amount equal
to the product of (i) the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Top
Up Option, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Amount, which amount shall be
paid in cash (by wire transfer or cashiers check) or, at the election of
Parent or Merger Sub, by delivery of a promissory note having full recourse to
Parent in the aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase
price for such Top Up Option Shares.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or
will be upon the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, an "Accredited
Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top Up Option and the Top Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act.

ARTICLE II.

_THE MERGER_

Section 2.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

Section 2.2. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue,
New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. (local time) as promptly as practicable
following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), or such other date,
time or place as is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."



 

6 Section 2.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant

Section 2.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving

7 ARTICLE III.

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT_

_CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS_

Section 3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares or
any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any Shares owned by Parent or
Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other than
Shares to be canceled in accordance with  _Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting
Shares) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the Per Share Amount. As of the Effective Time,
all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Per Share Amount to be paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_,
without interest.

Section 3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent, at
Parents sole expense, for the holders of Shares in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to
the Company, for the benefit of holders of Shares, the aggregate Per Share
Amount (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") to which holders of Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. Parent shall deposit the Merger
Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. The
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by
either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination
of the foregoing. Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the
Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this paragraph.



 

8 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than two business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of any Shares (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and
shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Share Amount, without interest, for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
If payment of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (y) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (z) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_ , without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
applicable Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_  shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates, and at
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of  _Section
3.2(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article III_.



 

9 (e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time after the date which falls 180 days
after of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 3.3. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Per Share Amount (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "),
but instead such holder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Per Share Amount for each such Share, in accordance with _Section
3.1_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company 



 

10  relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior consent of
Parent, offer to make or make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, or offer to settle any such demands.

Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Each stock option granted by the Company that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) that represents the right to acquire Shares (each, an "
_Option_ ") shall at the Effective Time vest in full and be cancelled,
terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Option Consideration for each Share then subject
to the Option. The Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no
event later than the first payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation which
follows the Effective Time, unless such payroll cycle occurs within three (3)
business days after the Effective Time, in which case the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the Option Consideration as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, but in no event later than the second payroll
cycle of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any Share
issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(i) the Per Share Amount over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of
such Share issuable under such Option.

(b) Each Share that is then subject to a risk of forfeiture (each, a "
_Restricted Share_ ") and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, at the Effective Time, vest in full and shall be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Amount without
interest from the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than the first payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation which follows the Effective Time, unless such payroll
cycle occurs within three (3) business days after the Effective Time, in which
case the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Per Share Amount as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than
the second payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, each right, contingent or accrued, to acquire or
receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of
any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable
or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans, other than Options
and Restricted Shares (the " _Company Awards_ "), shall vest in full and be
converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time (and, to the extent applicable, assuming target
levels of achievement under the respective award agreement and the Company
Stock Plan) times (ii) the Per Share Amount (or, if the Company Award
provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceeds a
specified reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share Amount
exceeds such reference price) (the " _Award Consideration_ "). The Award
Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than the first
payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation which follows the Effective Time,
unless such payroll cycle occurs within three (3) business days after the
Effective Time, in which case the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Award
Consideration as soon as practicable



 

11 following the Effective Time, but in no event later than the second payroll
cycle of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ to any holder
of Options, Restricted Shares and Company Awards such amount as the Surviving
Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, or local Tax Law, and
the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to
Tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of such Options, Restricted Shares or Company Awards,
as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.5. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
Shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of Shares or similar transaction, the Per Share Amount
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of Shares or similar transaction.

) the Company SEC Documents (as hereinafter defined) (excluding any risk
factor disclosures contained under the heading " _Risk Factors_ ," any

any other forward looking statements of risk that do not contain a reasonable
level of detail about the risks of which the statements warn) filed with the

such Company SEC Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any
section of this Article IV to which the matter relates to the extent the
relevance to each such section is reasonably apparent) and (c) with respect
to the Ancillary Agreements and the actions contemplated thereby:

Section 4.1. _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The Company is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in each
jurisdiction 



 

12  where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such licensing or qualification, except where
the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any
change, event, circumstance or occurrence that (a) is or is reasonably likely
to be materially adverse to the business, results of operations or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (b) would
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions by the Company
or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following, and no effect arising out of or resulting from the following,
shall constitute or be taken into account in determining whether a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur:

(i) any change, event, circumstance or occurrence generally affecting (A) the
prestige cosmetics industry, (B) direct and wholesale retail channels through
which the Companys goods are distributed or (C) the economy, credit or
financial or capital markets, in the United States or elsewhere in the world,
including changes in interest or exchange rates; or

(ii) any change, event, circumstance or occurrence arising out of, resulting
from or attributable to (A) changes or prospective changes in Law, in
applicable regulations of any Governmental Authority, in generally accepted
accounting principles or in accounting standards, or any changes or
prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the
foregoing, or changes or prospective changes in general legal, regulatory
or political conditions, (B) the negotiation, execution, announcement or
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions,
including the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with
customers, suppliers, distributors, partners or employees or regulators, or
any litigation arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or
violation of Law relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (C) acts of
war (whether or not declared), sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or
worsening of any such acts of war (whether or not declared), sabotage or
terrorism, (D) pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or other natural
disasters, (E) any action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries as
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or with Parents consent, or the
failure to take any action by the Company or its Subsidiaries if that action
is prohibited under this Agreement, (F) any change in the Companys credit
ratings, (G) any change resulting or arising from the identity of, or any
facts or circumstances relating to, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates or (H) any decline in the market price, or change in trading
volume, of the capital stock of the Company;

_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that any change, event, circumstance
or occurrence set forth in clause (i)(A) above may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or is a Material Adverse Effect to the
extent (and only to the extent) such change, event, circumstance or occurrence
have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as compared to other participants in the industries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that the exceptions in clauses (ii) (F) or (H) above shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that the underlying cause of any decline,
change or failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling within any of
the exceptions provided by clause (i) and clauses (ii)(A) through (D), (G) or
(H)) is a Material Adverse Effect.



 

13 (b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize the concept of good standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
(i) the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as amended to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter Documents_ ") and (ii)
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or equivalent organizational
documents, as amended to the date of this Agreement, of each material
Subsidiary of the Company.

Section 4.2. _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000
Shares and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ("

convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, the Company, (iii) no outstanding options,
warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from the
Company, or that obligate the Company to issue, any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, the Company, (iv) no obligations of the Company to grant, extend
or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable
security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in,
the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), together with the
capital stock of the Company, being referred to collectively as " _Company
Securities_ ") and (v) no other obligations by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any Company
Securities or dividends paid thereon or revenues, earnings or financial
performance or any other attribute of the Company. There are no outstanding
agreements of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities, or
obligating the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such agreements or
to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of the Company or any
other Person. No direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company owns any
Shares. All outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Since
September 27, 2009, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital
stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
any shares of its capital stock, other



 

14 than or pursuant to Options, Restricted Shares or RSUs, referred to above,
that are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or are hereafter issued
without violation of _Section 6.4_ hereof.

(c) All outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
each Subsidiary of the Company are owned directly or indirectly, beneficially
and of record, by the Company free and clear of all Liens and transfer
restrictions, except for such transfer restrictions of general applicability
as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), and other
applicable securities laws.  _Section 4.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company and the
ownership percentage of each such Subsidiary owned by the Company and/or any
of its Subsidiaries. Except as does not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company,
which is held, directly or indirectly, by the Company, is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There
are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts or other
commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements relating to the
issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase, sale or voting of any shares
of capital stock or other ownership interests of any Subsidiary of the
Company, including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding
security, instrument or agreement. 

Section 4.3. _Authority; Noncontravention; Voting Requirements_.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party
and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if required, in
respect of the Offer and the Merger, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by
such Ancillary Agreements. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party,
and the consummation by it of the Transactions and the transactions
contemplated by such Ancillary Agreements, have been duly authorized and
approved by its Board of Directors, and except for obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, if required, in respect of the Merger, no other
corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation by it of the
Transactions and the transactions contemplated by such Ancillary
Agreements. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which the Company
is a party has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery hereof and thereof by the other
parties hereto and thereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and
(ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity.

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, by resolutions duly adopted by
unanimous vote of those voting at a meeting duly called and held and not
subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, has, subject to _Section 6.5_,
(i) resolved to recommend that holders of 



 

15  Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, vote
their Shares in favor of the Merger, (ii) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to
enter into this Agreement, and (iii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has approved
the terms of the Employment Agreements and the LB Contribution Agreement as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement,"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, and taken all
other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to satisfy the requirements of
the non-exclusive safe harbor with respect to such agreements in accordance
with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, and the Board has determined
that the Compensation Committee is composed solely of "independent directors"
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act and the instructions thereto. The Board of Directors of the Company has
approved this Agreement and the Transaction in order that the restrictions on
business combinations set forth in Section 203(a) of the DGCL, and any
provision of the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Company
that would require any corporate approval other than that otherwise required
by the DGCL, shall not apply to the Transactions. 

(c) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party nor the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions or the transactions contemplated by such Ancillary
Agreements, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions
hereof and thereof, will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the
Company Charter Documents, (ii) conflict with or violate any provision of the
organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, except any such
conflicts or violations which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) assuming
that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section 4.4_
and the Company Stockholder Approval are obtained and the filings referred to
in _Section 4.4_ are made, (A) violate any Law, judgment, writ or injunction
of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) violate or constitute a default under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement, debenture, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, lease, license, contract or other
agreement (each, a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, or (C) result in the creation of any Lien on any
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the
case of clause (iii), for such violations or defaults as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or materially delay or impede

income or other material Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or

determination letter received with respect to each Company Pension Plan, as
well as a correct and complete copy of each pending application for a
determination letter, if any. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would be deemed a single employer

multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) or any defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA)
subject to Title IV of ERISA. No Company Plan that is a welfare benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) provides material benefits to former
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than pursuant to Section
4980B of the Code or any similar Law. Neither the execution of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone
or in connection with any subsequent event(s)) will result in any material
payment that would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) to any current employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

and from time to time thereafter, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate
up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the
Board of Directors of the Company as shall give Merger Sub representation on
the Board of Directors of the Company equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this _Section 6.3_) multiplied by the

number of Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly take all actions necessary to, upon
Merger Subs request, cause Merger Subs designees to be elected or appointed
as directors of the Company, including increasing the size of the Board of
Directors of the Company or securing the resignations of incumbent directors,
or both. At such times, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause persons designated by Merger Sub to constitute the same percentage as
persons designated by Merger Sub shall constitute of the Board of Directors of
the Company of (i) each committee of the Board, (ii) each board of directors
(or other similar body) of each Subsidiary and (iii) each committee of each
such board, in each case only to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

any Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any
other reason, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
elect or designate another individual who serves as a director on the date of
this Agreement (provided that no such individual is an employee of the Company
or any Subsidiary) to fill the vacancy, and such director shall be deemed
to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, to fulfill
its obligations under this _Section 6.3_, and shall include in the Schedule

and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill
such obligations. Parent or Merger Sub shall supply in writing to the Company,
and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to either of them
and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

of Directors pursuant to this _Section 6.3_, prior to the Effective Time, the
approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who
neither were designated by Merger Sub nor are employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary shall be required to authorize (and such approval shall constitute
the authorization of the Board of Directors of the Company and no other action
on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) any amendment or modification of this
Agreement or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, any

expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling either Parents or Merger
Subs obligations hereunder, and shall have the authority following the
election of Merger Subs designees to the Companys Board of Directors

conditioned), the Company shall conduct its business, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses, in all material respects
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. To the extent

Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company shall not, shall
direct each of its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information other than in the
ordinary course of business) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any
proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to the Companys
stockholders) that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Takeover Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding a Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into
any agreement or agreement in principle with respect to a Takeover Proposal.
The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct each of their
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to the execution
of this Agreement by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of
their Representatives with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall not release any Person from, or waive any provision of, and
shall, to the extent possible, promptly take all steps necessary to terminate
any such waiver previously granted with respect to, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it is a party. The Company shall promptly
request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement that remains
in effect as of the date of this Agreement in connection with such Persons
consideration of any Takeover Proposal to return (or to the extent permitted
by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all information required
to be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms
of such Persons confidentiality agreement with the Company and, if requested
by Parent, to enforce such Persons obligation to do so.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.5(a)_,
if at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and until the purchase
of Shares by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer, the Company or its
Representatives receives an unsolicited, written, bona fide Takeover Proposal
from any Person or group of Persons, which Takeover Proposal was made on or
after the date of this Agreement and which did not arise or result from any
breach of this _Section 6.5_, (i) the Company and its Representatives may
contact such Person or group of 



 

34  Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the Board of
Directors of the Company, or any committee thereof, determines in good faith,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its
Representatives may (A) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made
such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly provide
to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is made available to any such Person, which was not
previously made available to Parent or its Representatives; and (B) engage in
or otherwise participate in discussions and/or negotiations with the Person
or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that, with
respect to each of clause (A) and (B) above, the Company shall provide written
notice to Parent of its intent to furnish information or enter into
discussions with such Person prior to taking any such action. For the purposes
of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any
confidentiality agreement (i) currently in existence or (ii) entered into
after the date of this Agreement that contains provisions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in _Section 6.5(a)_, the Company shall be permitted to grant a waiver or
release to any Person or group of Persons subject to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement for the sole purpose of allowing such Person or
Group of Persons to submit a Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of
the Company, or any committee thereof, determines in good faith could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal if the Board of
Directors determines that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent, orally and in writing, after the
receipt by the Company, any Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or
any Subsidiary of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any
amendment thereto) relating to or constituting a Takeover Proposal or any
transaction that the Company believes could reasonably constitute a Takeover
Proposal, including any request for discussions or negotiations, any request
for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
request for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent the
Company believes such request could reasonably lead to a Takeover Proposal.
Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal,
inquiry, offer or request and the terms and conditions of such proposed
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent copies of
any written materials received by the Company in connection with any of the
foregoing. The Company agrees that it shall keep Parent informed of the status
and material details of (including discussions with respect to or amendments
or proposed amendments to) (i) any such proposed Takeover Proposal, request
or inquiry and (ii) any information requested of or provided by the Company
(pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_). Except as expressly permitted by this 
_Section 6.5(c)_, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i)(A)
change, qualify, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (B) take any action or make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act or (C) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to 



 

35  approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or
similar agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Board of
Directors of the Company may change, qualify, withdraw or modify, in any
manner adverse to the Parent, the Company Board Recommendation if such Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 6.5(c)_ unless the Company has provided
written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent
that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior
Proposal promptly after the Board of Directors of the Company determines it
has received a Superior Proposal, stating that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and the manner
in which it intends to do so, specifying the information required to be
included in any notice required to be delivered to Parent under _Section
6.5(b)_.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall prohibit the Board of Directors of
the Company from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if
such Board determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to so disclose such position would constitute a violation of
applicable Law; _provided_ that such disclosure states that no action will be
taken by the Board of Directors of the Company in violation of this _Section
6.5_. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement (including _Article VIII_ ), a factually accurate public statement
by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any similar communication to the
stockholders of the Company, shall not constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or a withdrawal or modification, or proposal by the
Board of Directors of the Company to withdraw or modify, such Boards
recommendation of this Agreement or the Transactions, or an approval or
recommendation with respect to any Takeover Proposal. Any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of the Board of Directors
of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other
state law to be inapplicable to the Transactions.

(e) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any (i) acquisition of assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales
of assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to 20% or more of the
Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii)
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Shares, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more 



 

36  of the outstanding Shares, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company, or (v) any combination of the foregoing
types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets,
consolidated revenues or earnings and Shares involved is 20% or more; in each
case, other than the Transactions.

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares than the Merger,
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including
the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof), and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent
to the Company in writing in response to such proposal or otherwise);
_provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of " _Superior Proposal_ ,"
the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "50%."

Section 6.6. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties hereto and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions
to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable
and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and
fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of (A) a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 10 business days of the date hereof and
(B) any notifications required by any Foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and, in each case, to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions consistent with this _Section 6.6_ necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and Foreign
Antitrust Laws (including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable; and
(ii) the Company 



 

37  and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (A) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (B) if any state takeover
statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed
in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to the other parties hereto
and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, other than
"4(c) documents" as that term if used in the rules and regulations of the HSR
Act.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.6_, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions.

Section 6.7. _Financing_. At the cost and expense of Parent, the Company shall
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with the arrangement by Parent of any financing to be
consummated prior to or contemporaneously with the Offer or the Closing in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any
such arrangements, the " _Financing_ ").

Section 6.8. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except with respect to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto,
and in accordance with _Section 6.5_ and _Article VIII_ , neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
may be required by Law, applicable fiduciary duties or by any applicable
listing agreement or rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange or NASDAQ as determined
in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in
which case such party shall not 



 

38  issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party).

Section 6.9. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to
Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to the Companys properties, books, Contracts and records and the
Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning its
business and properties as Parent may reasonably request (other than any
publicly available document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities Laws); _provided_ , that Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law, constitute a material
breach of a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party,
create a material risk of waiver of an attorney-client privilege or expose
the Company to material risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personal information. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will
be subject to the terms of the letter agreement, dated as of September 19,
2009, between the Company and Parent (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to,
use such information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions.

Section 6.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event, the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of which could reasonably be expected to cause any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect; _provided_ that any such notice by the Company shall not be
deemed to have qualified or modified the representations and warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement for the purposes of determining
whether the conditions specified in _Article VII_ have been satisfied, (b)
any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder, (c) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (d) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or, involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions and any other material development relating to the business,
prospects, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



 

39 Section 6.11. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company and the
Surviving Corporation to honor and abide by the indemnification agreements
listed on _Section 6.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall
survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms, in each case, whether or not the
Companys insurance covers all such costs. Parent, for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification and limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and advancement of expenses than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of each individual who, at the Effective Time is,
or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or an officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ").

(b) Parent shall bear the full cost of, and shall cause the Company to
maintain in effect, for at least six years commencing on and immediately
following the Effective Time, one or more director and officer tail
policy(ies) as described below (collectively, the " _D andO Tail Policies_").
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain one or more prepaid,
fully-earned and non-cancellable DandO Tail Policies applicable on and after the
Effective Time, for a period equal to, at the Companys sole discretion, the
greater of (i) six years immediately following the Effective Time and (ii) the
statute(s) of limitations applicable to the acts and omissions of the
directors and officers of the Company up through and including the Effective
Time (the greater of such periods, the " _D andO Tail Period_"), in lieu of the
current policies or directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company. Such DandO Tail Policies shall provide at least the same coverage
with respect to amounts, terms and conditions, as the directors and officers
liability insurance policies (including, but not limited to, both primary and
any and all excess policies) maintained by the Company on the date
hereof (collectively, the " _Current D andO Policies_"), or policies with at
least the same coverage limits and amounts as the Current DandO Policies,
containing terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the individuals
or the Company covered by such Current DandO Policies, than the terms of such
policies, so long as the Company is not required to pay a premium in excess of
200% (the dollar amount of such percentage being the " _Maximum Premium_ ") of
the last annual premium paid in the aggregate by the Company for such Current
DandO Policies (which premium is set forth on _Schedule 6.11(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule). If the Company is unable to obtain, or unable to cause
to be obtained, the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount
less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, it shall instead obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for a director and officer tail premium equal
to the Maximum Premium for the DandO Tail Period, _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the Parent hereby
covenants that it shall take any necessary actions to ensure that at no time
shall the coverage for the Indemnities be less than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage then provided by Parent to its
directors and officers. Neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall take,
or allow to be taken, any action to terminate, or which could reasonably be
expected to result in the termination of, the DandO Tail Policies, during the
DandO Tail Period. Parent hereby agrees to allow the Company to arrange, with
the insurance broker of the Companys choosing, for the negotiation and
purchase of the DandO Tail Policies.



 

40 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.11_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnitee to whom this  _Section 6.11_ applies unless (y) such termination
or modification is required by applicable Law or (z) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.11_).

(d) Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that an Indemnitee has or may, in
the future, have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and/or insurance provided by other entities and/or organizations
(collectively, the " _Other Indemnitors_ " and, individually, an " _Other
Indemnitor_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree that, with
respect to any advancement or indemnification obligation owed, at any time, to
an Indemnitee by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any Other Indemnitor, whether pursuant to any certificate of incorporation,
by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, indemnification agreement
or other document or agreement and/or pursuant to _Section 6.11_ of this
Agreement (any of the foregoing is herein an " _Indemnification Agreement_ ")
(i) the Surviving Corporation shall, at all times, be the indemnitor of first
resort (i.e., its obligations to an Indemnitee shall be primary and any
obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by an Indemnitee
shall be secondary), (ii) it shall, at all times, be required to advance the
full amount of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee and shall be liable for the
full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of
this Agreement or any Indemnification Agreement), without regard to any rights
an Indemnitee may have against the Other Indemnitors, and (iii) it irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all
claims against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation,
indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby further agree that no advancement,
indemnification or other payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an
Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which an Indemnitee has sought
indemnification from the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall affect the
foregoing, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution
and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement, indemnification or
other payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnitee against the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, and the Company and/or the Surviving
Corporation shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless against
such amounts actually paid by the Other Indemnitors to or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to the extent such amounts would have otherwise been payable by the
Company or the Surviving Corporation under the Indemnitees indemnification
agreement with the Company or under the Company Charter Documents.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each



 

41 such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

Section 6.12.  _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses.

Section 6.13. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999
issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

Section 6.14. _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who is employed as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") annual base salary and base
wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation) and benefits that, in each case, are no less favorable than such
annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities
(excluding equity-based compensation) and benefits provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Surviving Company from,
consistent with the Companys past practice, terminating the employment of
any Company Employee or demoting any such Company Employee (with a
corresponding change, if applicable and consistent with past practice, to such
Company Employees annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive
compensation opportunities and benefits) in each case for cause, and, if
applicable, in accordance with the provisions of the Company Employees
employment or other individual agreement, consistent with the Companys past
practice. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
Company Employees whose employment terminates during the eighteen (18) month
period following the Effective Time who are not parties to individual
agreements providing severance or termination benefits with severance benefits
at levels no less than the benefits provided under the Companys
severance policies in effect as of December 31, 2009, and such severance
benefits shall be determined taking into account the service crediting
provisions set forth in _Section 6.14(b)_ below.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the
Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company employee benefit plan in which such Company 



 

42  Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans
to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage
under a Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "),
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all premium, deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay each
participant in any and/or all bonus plans or programs maintained by the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Bonus Plan_ "), who remains
employed through the Effective Time for the applicable bonus period in which
the Effective Time occurs, a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the bonus
award earned by such participant for the applicable bonus period in which the
Effective Time occurs under the Bonus Plan (assuming a full period of
performance) based upon actual or target performance, as determined in the
sole discretion of the Company, and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days elapsed in the plan year from the commencement of the
most recent plan period until the date on which the Effective Time occurs and
the denominator of which is 360 for annual bonus plans or 90 for quarterly
bonus plans, as applicable. Following the payment of pro rata bonuses as
provided in the preceding sentence (the " _Pro Rata Bonus_ "), Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to (A) maintain a bonus plan or plans for the
remainder of the year in which the Effective Time occurs on comparable terms
and conditions and pursuant to comparable targets and performance measures as
were in effect for such entire year, adjusted as appropriate in consultation
with Leslie Blodgett and Myles McCormick to reflect performance expectations
for the Company following the Transactions and (B) pay bonuses, to the extent
earned, no later than 75 days following the end of the year and 30 days
following the end of each quarter which ends subsequent to the Effective Time
during the remainder of the year following the Effective Time, in an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the bonus that was earned by the each
participant for the applicable period under the Bonus Plan described in
clause (i) above, taking into account the entire applicable period over (2)
any Pro Rata Bonus previously paid in respect of such applicable period,
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no case shall such amount be less than zero.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Plans and 



 

43  compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_
that, subject to the requirements of  _Section 6.14(a)_, nothing herein
shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any
particular Company Plan to the extent permitted by its terms or applicable
Law.

(e) Parent acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of control"
within the meaning of each Company Plan and Company Stock Plan will occur
upon the Effective Time.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.14_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any other
individual associate therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

Section 6.15. _State Takeover Statute_. The Company and the Board of Directors
of the Company (a) shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state
takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 6.16. _Delisting_. Parent shall cause the Companys securities to be
de-listed from NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

ARTICLE VII.

_CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER_

Section 7.1. _Conditions to the Merger_. The respective obligations of each
party hereto to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction (or
waiver, if permissible under applicable Law) on or prior to the Closing Date
of the following conditions:

(a) _Company Stockholder Approval_. If and to the extent required by the DGCL
and the certificate of incorporation of the Company, the Company Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained;

(b) _No Injunctions or Restraints_. No Law, injunction, judgment or ruling
enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any Governmental
Authority (collectively, " _Restraints_ ") shall be in effect enjoining,
restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger or making
the consummation of the Merger illegal; and

(c) _Offer_. Merger Sub or its permitted assignee shall have purchased all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.



 

44 ARTICLE VIII.

_TERMINATION_

Section 8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding any requisite adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions
by the stockholders of the Company:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective Boards of Directors; or

 

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

(i) if the acceptance and payment for the Shares pursuant to the Offer shall
not have been consummated on or before May 31, 2010 (the " _Walk-Away Date_
"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party if the
failure to consummate the acceptance and payment for the Shares pursuant to
the Offer on or before the Walk-Away Date was primarily due to the failure of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, or
which would enjoin, restrain, prevent or prohibit the commencement or closing
of the Offer, or make the commencement or closing of the Offer illegal, shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final,
non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

(c) by Parent:

(i) if, due to an occurrence or circumstance that would result in a failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in  _Annex A_ hereto, Merger Sub shall have
(A) failed to commence the Offer within 30 days following the date of this
Agreement, (B) terminated the Offer without having accepted any Shares for
payment thereunder or (C) failed to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer within 90 days following the commencement of the Offer, unless such
action or inaction under (A), (B) or (C) shall have been caused by or resulted
from the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to perform, in any material respect,
any of their material covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or
the material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement; _provided_  that the failure of (y)
the Antitrust Condition or (z) the condition set forth in paragraph (a) of
_Annex A_ to be satisfied shall not give rise to a termination right under
part (A) or (B) of this paragraph; 

(ii) if there has been a Material Adverse Effect; or

(iii)(A) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall
have effected or resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change 



 

45  or (B) the Company fails to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9; or

(d) by the Company:

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have (A) failed to commence the Offer
within 30 days following the date of this Agreement, (B) terminated the Offer
without having accepted any Shares for payment thereunder or (C) failed to
accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer within 90 days following the
commencement of the Offer, unless such action or inaction under (A), (B) or
(C) shall have been caused by or resulted from (y) the failure of the Company
to perform, in any material respect, any of its material covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or the material breach by the Company
of any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or (z)
the failure of the Antitrust Condition or the condition set forth in
paragraph (a) of _Annex A_ to be satisfied; or

(ii) in order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal,
if, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines that it has received a Superior Proposal,
(B) the Company has complied in all material respects with the requirements
of  _Section 6.5_, and (C) prior to or concurrently with such termination,

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void (other than _Sections 6.12_ , _8.2_ and _8.3_ , _Article IX_ , the
last sentence of  _Section 6.8_ and the Confidentiality Agreement in
accordance with its terms, all of which shall survive termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto,
except (a) the Company may have liability as provided in _Section 8.3_, and
(b) nothing shall relieve any Party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination, except as provided in _Section 8.3_.

Section 8.3. _Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that:

(i)(A) this Agreement is terminated (y) by either party pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ or (z) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ as a result of a
failure of conditions (d) or (e) to the Offer (as set forth in _Annex A_
hereto) to be satisfied and (B) (y) the Company enters into an agreement with
respect to a Takeover Proposal within 12 months after such termination and
such Takeover Proposal is thereafter consummated at any time or (z) a Takeover
Proposal is consummated within 12 months after the termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the
references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be references to "50%;"

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_; or

 



 

46 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_; 

then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the termination fee in an
amount equal to $43,528,152 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of
same day funds, it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent.

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions; accordingly, if
the Company fails to timely pay the Termination Fee (i) the Company shall pay
interest on the Termination Fee, and (ii) if, in order to obtain the payment,
Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for
the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount.
The interest amounts payable pursuant to each of (i) and (ii) shall be
calculated at the prime rate announced by Bank of America (or any successor
thereto) plus 200 basis points, calculated from the date such payment was
required to be made through the date such payment was actually made.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including _Section
8.2_), in the event that the Termination Fee is paid in accordance with this 
_Section 8.3_, the payment of such Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective subsidiaries,
shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives
against the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives or
Affiliates with respect to (i) any loss suffered, directly or indirectly, as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (ii) the termination of
this Agreement, (iii) any liabilities or obligations arising under this
Agreement or (iv) any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any
breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement.

Section 8.4. _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all
of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement.
Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and complete
performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its
respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable for any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance and not collectability. Parent hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any
right to require any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in
connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this _Section
8.4_.



 

47 ARTICLE IX.

_MISCELLANEOUS_

Section 9.1. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
_Section 9.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that
by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (a) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (b) terminate as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2. _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective
Boards of Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that following approval of the
Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, if required by applicable
Law, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by
Law would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company. 

Section 9.3. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 9.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 9.4_ shall be
null and void.

Section 9.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

Section 9.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the exhibits hereto,
together with the other instruments referred to herein, including the
Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality 



 

48  Agreement, (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b)
except for the provisions set forth in _Section 6.11_ of this Agreement, are
not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 9.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably
waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such
action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than
the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable law.

Section 9.8.  _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond or other security). The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. Specific performance pursuant to this
provision shall be in addition to any other remedy to which the parties are
entitled at law or in equity.

Section 9.9. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
