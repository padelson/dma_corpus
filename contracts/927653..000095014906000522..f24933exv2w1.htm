cash, without interest (the &#147;<I>Merger Consideration</I>&#148;), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender

PARENT AND MERGER SUB</B>

Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has all requisite corporate power and authority and
possesses all governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it
to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties
and other assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to
have such governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals individually or in the
aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be likely to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4.02. <U>Authority</U>. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate

Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this

Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
