ARTICLE II 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
 CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), or of any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, no shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be canceled pursuant to this Section 2.01(b); and 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), any Dissenting Shares and any shares that are owned by a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, which shall remain outstanding) shall be converted into the right to receive $28.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of such share in the manner provided in Section 2.04. At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.04(b). The right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of withholding (if any) that is required to be made under applicable Tax Law. 

   

 SECTION 2.02. _Treatment of Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company Deferred Stock Units_. (a) The Company shall provide that, as of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any Company Stock Plan which, in each case, is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested, exercisable or not exercisable), shall be canceled by the Company, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive promptly following the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount (less the amount of withholding (if any) that is required to be made under applicable Tax Law) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option. 

   ##### 

  

 

In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be
canceled without payment therefor and have no further force or effect. 

   

 (b) Except as provided in Section 2.02(c), the Company shall provide that, as of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company RSUs_ ") which, in each case, is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled by the Company and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive promptly following the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount (less the amount of withholding (if any) that is required to be made under applicable Tax Law) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU. 

   

 (c) (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to assume the obligations of the Company under the Companys 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the " _Company LTIP_ ") with respect to Company RSUs that are service-based restricted stock units (" _Company Service-Based RSUs_ ") and the Companys board of directors shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following: 

    

 (A) At the Effective Time, each Company Service-Based RSU granted by the Company under the Company LTIP, which is outstanding and which has not been settled by the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent a right to receive upon settlement shares of Company Common Stock and shall instead be assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a right (a " _Converted RSU_ ") to receive upon settlement (otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Company LTIP and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder) such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") as is equal to (I) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Service-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time  _multiplied by_ (II) the quotient of (x) the Merger Consideration _divided by_ (y) the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date. 

   

 (B) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Converted RSU an appropriate notice evidencing the foregoing assumption of the restricted stock unit award by Parent. Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company LTIP and the agreements, subject to the adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.02(c). Each holder of a Converted RSU shall be credited with such holders service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining such holders vesting under such Converted RSU. 

   

 (ii) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon the settlement of Converted RSUs. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to the Converted RSUs. 

  

 (d) (i) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to assume the obligations of the Company under the Companys Deferred Stock Unit Plan (the " _Company DSU Plan_ ") with respect to deferred amount stock units (each a " _Company Deferred Amount Stock Unit_ ") and enhancement bonus stock units (each a " _Company Enhancement Bonus Stock Unit_ " and, together with the Company Deferred Amount Stock Units, the " _Company Deferred Stock Units_ ") and the Companys board of directors shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following: 

    

 (A) At the Effective Time, each Company Deferred Stock Unit outstanding under the Company DSU Plan, which has not been distributed immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent a right to receive upon distribution shares of Company Common Stock and shall instead be assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a right (a " _Converted Deferred Stock Unit_ ") to receive upon distribution (otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Company DSU Plan) such number of shares Parent Common Stock as is equal to (I) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (II) the quotient of (x) the Merger Consideration _divided by_ (y) the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date. 

   

 (B) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Converted Deferred Stock Unit an appropriate notice evidencing the foregoing assumption by Parent. Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company DSU Plan and any related agreements, subject to the adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.02(d). Each holder of a Converted Deferred Stock Unit shall be credited with such holders service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining such holders vesting under such Converted Deferred Stock Unit. 

   

 (ii) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon the settlement of Converted Deferred Stock Units. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Converted Deferred Stock Units. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary in order to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.02. 

   

 (f) It is the intent of the parties that the Converted RSUs and Converted Deferred Stock Units shall comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), so as to avoid the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties in respect of deferred compensation, and that, to the extent necessary to comply with such section, the provisions of this Section 2.02 shall be construed in a manner consistent with such intent and adjusted, to the extent necessary, to avoid a failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 2.03. _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders that have properly demanded and perfected their appraisal rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and the holder thereof shall not receive the Merger Consideration as compensation for such cancellation, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, at the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon and less the amount of withholding (if any) that is required to be made under applicable Tax Law) as compensation for such cancellation. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice received by the Company of intent to demand appraisal with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights. 

   

 SECTION 2.04. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint The Bank of New York or another bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Certificates, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04(b) may be made to a person other   ##### 

  

  

  

than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.04(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Certificates. 

   

 (c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. 

   

 (e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or distributions from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to four years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

   

 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable   ##### 

  

  

  

amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this Article II. 

   

 (h) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

   ##### 

  

    

stockholders solely for the purpose of adopting this Agreement (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ "), (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval (for the sake of clarity, it is understood that
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company in accordance with
Section 6.04 shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section) and (iii)
subject to Section 6.04, include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of
the Board of Directors (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the Companys obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01(a)
shall, consistent with Section 6.04(c), not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Takeover Proposal. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to hold the Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01. 

   

 SECTION 6.02. _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the Stockholders Meeting to be held to consider adoption of this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and Parent and its counsel shall be given the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Proxy Statement and any related materials, including any letters prepared in response to any SEC comments, which comments shall be given reasonable consideration by the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable (i) notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.

   ##### 

  

    

furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to) so confer, afford such access or
furnish such copies or other information to the extent that doing so would
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege. If any of the information or
material furnished pursuant to this Section 6.03 includes materials or
information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal
proceedings or governmental investigations, each party understands and agrees
that the parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters
and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the parties that
the sharing of such material or information is not intended to, and shall not,
waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or
information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information
provided by the Company that is entitled to protection under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall
remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement,
and under the joint defense doctrine.

 (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold, and shall cause their respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to hold, all information received from the other party, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject to, the terms and conditions of that certain confidentiality agreement, dated as of September 18, 2006, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in paragraph 11 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be inapplicable with respect to any of the transactions set forth in this Agreement or any proposals, negotiations or actions by or on behalf of Parent related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 6.04(b)). The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.03 or information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement.

 SECTION 6.04. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its and their respective directors or officers shall, and the Company shall not authorize or permit any of its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives, including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent, representative, intermediary or Affiliate (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to result in or facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any person other than Parent. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors and officers to, and shall cause its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines (after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof in violation of the first and second sentences of this Section 6.04(a) and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of the first and second sentences of this Section 6.04(a), the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.04, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive to such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that (x) the standstill provision contained in such confidentiality agreement shall not restrict, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary may be waived by the Company to the extent necessary to allow, such person from making any proposals, negotiations or actions in response to any proposals, negotiations or actions taken by or on behalf of Parent in connection with any exercise by Parent of its rights under this Section 6.04 and (y) the provisions set forth in paragraph 12 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be a part of any such confidentiality agreement entered into with any such person making such Takeover Proposal), _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

  

 The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer (or any communication or affirmation in support of any previously made inquiry, proposal or offer) from any person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute 15% or more of 

    ##### 

  

    

the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company
or any Subsidiary, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company, or (iii) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of any
person would own 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other
than the transactions pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide offer proposed by a third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 80% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines (after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any break-up fee, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) and the person making the proposal, to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise) and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set forth in the proposal. 

   

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation or (B) make any public statement in connection with the Company Recommendation or Stockholders Meeting, or in reference to a Takeover Proposal, that is materially inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.04(a)) or any tender offer constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal; or (iii) waive any provision of, terminate, amend, restate or otherwise modify the Company Rights Plan or redeem the Company Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and subject to Section 6.04(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board reasonably determines (after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was not solicited in violation of the first and second sentences of Section 6.04(a) and was made after the date hereof, (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) terminate this Agreement and, concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if the Board   ##### 

  

  

  

of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of
Directors to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.04(b), and any purported
termination or approval pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no
force or effect, unless the Company pays to Parent the fee payable pursuant
to Section 8.02(b) prior to or concurrently with such termination pursuant to
this Section 6.04(b); and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Board
of Directors shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless the
Company has: 

    

 (i) provided to Parent three Business Days prior written notice (such notice, a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors and the identity of the person making the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any material amendment to any other material term of any such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new three Business Day period); 

   

 (ii) during such three Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that any Takeover Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal; and 

   

 (iii) at the end of such three Business Day period, determined that such Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent following a Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations between Parent and the Company pursuant to clause (ii) or otherwise). 

  

 In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was neither known to the Board of Directors of the Company nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof (and not relating to any Takeover Proposal) (such material development or change in circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that, the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (x) provided to Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice (unless the Intervening Event arises fewer than three Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting in which case the Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after 

   ##### 

  

 

such Intervening Event arises) advising Parent that the Board of Directors of
the Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor
in reasonable detail and (y) during such three Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of the Intervening Event. 

   

 (c) Any Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any other approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 8.01, (i) the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys stockholders on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.04, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.04, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent fully informed in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Takeover Proposal and (y) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) (2) or (3) under the Exchange Act, making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure of factual matters to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would violate its obligations under applicable Law, including the duty of candor to the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) compliance with such rules shall in no way limit or modify the effect that any such action pursuant to such rules has under this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 6.04(b). 

   

 SECTION 6.05. _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, person or division
thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition would be reasonably likely to result in not obtaining the
applicable clearance, approval or waiver from an Antitrust Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with any filing or
submission required or action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to
consummate the Merger, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking
or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or

Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) to (A) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, either before or after
giving effect to the Merger, or (B) Parents ownership or operation of
any portion of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries business or
assets.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action, agree to take any action or consent to the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 6.05 (including with respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of assets or conducting its business in a specified manner). 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.05 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or Section 8.01(b)(ii), as applicable, so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.05.

In the event Parent takes any action to cause the Surviving Corporation to be, or if any action specified in clause (i) or (ii) in the preceding sentence renders the Surviving Corporation (or its successor or assign), unable to satisfy the obligations referred to in Section 6.06(a), Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the Surviving Corporation or the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall perform the obligations under Section 6.06(a).

It is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or less in the aggregate, Parent shall only be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such aggregate amount.

For the avoidance of doubt, Parent hereby expressly assumes and agrees to perform the Companys obligations under the employment agreements and Company Stock Plans listed in Section 6.09(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform such obligations if the Merger had not taken place.

 (d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan, to the extent credited under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.09, the provisions of Section 6.09(a), (c) and (d) shall apply only with respect to Continuing Employees who are covered under Company Benefit Plans that are maintained primarily for the benefit of employees employed in the United States (including Continuing Employees regularly employed outside the United States to the extent they participate in such Company Benefit Plans). With respect to Continuing Employees not described in the preceding sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable Laws relating to employees and employee benefits matters applicable to such employees.

 SECTION 6.10. _Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated: 

    

 (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if, at the time of such termination, either (1) the Company is in breach or shall have failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) and (y) is not capable of being cured prior to the Closing or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the Company within 10 calendar days following receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Parent or (2) Parent was entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (C), (D) or (E) below;

the event of a termination 

   ##### 

  

    

by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(f), prior to or
concurrently with such termination). 

  

 (c) In the event that (i): 

    

 (A) (1) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the Company or directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, and (2) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (except in the event that at the time of such termination all conditions to Closing shall have been satisfied or waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, would be satisfied or waived if the Closing were held on the date of such termination) other than the condition set forth in Section 7.01(b)) or by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c), in each case in circumstances not requiring payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.02(b); or 

   

 (B) (1) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, a Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, and (2) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) in circumstances not requiring payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.02(b), 

   

then (ii) if at any time prior to the date that is 12 months after any such
termination referred to in this Section 8.02(c), the Company enters into a
definitive Contract with respect to, or consummates the transactions
contemplated by, any Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether such Takeover
Proposal is made or consummated before or after termination of this
Agreement), then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of same-
day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of the first to occur of such
event(s) referred to above in this clause (ii) of this Section 8.02(c). For
purposes of clause (ii) of this Section 8.02(c) only, the term " _Takeover
Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.04(a)
except that all references to "15%" therein shall be deemed to be references
to "more than 50%". 

  

 (d) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in Section 8.02(b) and Section 8.02(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly (i) if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.02(b) or Section 8.02(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 SECTION 8.03. _Amendment_.

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 8.04. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and subject to the first sentence of this Section 8.04, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or, with respect to any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03, a duly authorized committee of its Board of Directors to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
