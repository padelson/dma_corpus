 ** ****Section 3.2 Initial Purchase Price**.

  

The initial purchase price for the Purchased Assets being sold shall be One
Hundred Seventy Million Dollars (U.S. $170,000,000) (the " _Initial Purchase
Price_ ").

  

 ** Section 3.3 Adjustments to Initial Purchase Price**.

  

 (a)   _Adjustment Sections_. The Initial Purchase Price shall be subject to such adjustments as are specified in this _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.4_ and as may occur under the provisions of _Section 3.5_ (this _Section 3.3_ , _Section 3.4_ and _Section 3.5_ being referred to as the " _Adjustment Sections,_ " and the Initial Purchase Price as so adjusted is herein referred to as the " _Purchase Price_ ").  The Initial Purchase Price shall also be adjusted to account for the items prorated as of the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 3.4_.

  

 (b)   _Inventory_. The Parties agree that the Initial Purchase Price assumes a quantity of Purchased Inventory, in the aggregate, with a book value of one million eight hundred eighty two thousand seven hundred and seventy seven Dollars ($1,882,777) (the " _Inventory Threshold_ ").  Accordingly, the Parties agree that the Initial Purchase Price shall be further adjusted by the difference between the Inventory Threshold and the book value of the Purchased Inventory as of the Closing (determined in the same manner as the initial valuation of the Purchased Inventory for determining Inventory Threshold) (the " _Inventory Value_ "). The Initial Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by the amount by which the Inventory Value exceeds the Inventory Threshold, or (ii) decreased by the amount by which the Inventory Value is less than the Inventory Threshold.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_ unless the difference between the Inventory Threshold and the Inventory Value exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

  

 ** Section 3.4 Prorations**.

  

 (a)  Purchaser and Seller agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all of the ordinary and recurring items normally incurred by Seller (but excluding all Taxes other than Property Taxes) relating to the Business and operation of the Project shall be prorated and charged as of the Closing Date, without any duplication of payment under the Purchased Project Contracts, with Seller liable to the extent such items relate to any time periods (tax year periods for Property Tax) ending on or prior to the 

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

Closing Date, and Purchaser liable to the extent such items relate to periods
(tax year periods for Property Tax) after the Closing (measured in the same
units used to compute the item in question and otherwise measured by calendar
days); provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Purchaser shall not pay any amount under this _Section 3.4_ that constitutes
an Excluded Liability.

  

 (b)  In connection with the prorations referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ above, in the event that actual figures are not available at the Closing Date, the proration shall be based upon the applicable amounts accrued through the Closing Date or paid for the most recent year or other appropriate period for which such amounts paid are available. All prorated amounts shall be recalculated and paid to the appropriate Party within thirty (30) days after the date that the previously unavailable actual figures become available. Seller and Purchaser shall furnish each other with such documents and other records as may be reasonably requested in order to confirm all proration calculations made pursuant to this _Section 3.4_.

  

 ** Section 3.5 Procedures for Closing Adjustments**.

  

 (a)  At least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Purchaser, with the assistance and participation of, and in consultation with, Seller, shall prepare and deliver to Seller an estimated closing statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") that shall set forth Purchaser\'s best estimate of all estimated adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price required by this Agreement to be made as of the Closing (the " _Estimated Closing Adjustment_ "). The Estimated Closing Adjustment, insofar as it relates to the adjustment required by _Section 3.3(b)_ , will be based on an Inventory survey which shall be conducted by Seller, in consultation with Purchaser, within thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date consistent with Seller\'s current inventory practices and the results of which shall be delivered by Seller to Purchaser promptly upon completion. Seller shall provide at least five (5) Business Days advance written notice to Purchaser of the commencement of such Inventory survey and shall, to the extent Purchaser reasonably requests, permit Purchaser to observe and monitor Seller\'s conduct of the Inventory survey. Within ten (10) calendar days after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement by Purchaser to Seller, Seller may object in good faith to the Estimated Closing Adjustment in writing. If Seller objects to the Estimated Closing Adjustment within such ten (10) calendar day period, the Parties shall attempt to resolve their differences by negotiation. If the Parties are unable to do so prior to the Closing Date (or if Seller does not object to the Estimated Closing Adjustment), the Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted (the " _Closing Adjustment_ ") at the Closing by the amount of the Estimated Closing Adjustment not in dispute. The disputed portion shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.6_.

  

 (b)  Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser, with the assistance and participation of, and in consultation with, Seller, shall prepare and deliver to Seller a final closing statement (the _" Post-Closing Statement"_) that shall set forth all adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price proposed by Purchaser to be required by this Agreement to be made as of the Closing to the extent not previously effected by the Closing Adjustment (the _" Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment"_). To the extent applicable, the Post-Closing 

   **EXECUTION VERSION**

  

Statement shall be prepared using the same accounting principles, policies
and methods as Seller has historically used in connection with the
calculation of the items reflected on the Post-Closing Statement. Within
thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement by
Purchaser to Seller, Seller may object in good faith to the Proposed Post-
Closing Adjustment in writing, stating in reasonable detail its objections
thereto. To the extent any amounts are undisputed, the Initial Purchase
Price shall be further adjusted (the _" Post-Closing Adjustment"_) by the
amount of the Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment not in dispute, effective as
of the earlier of the date Purchaser receives Seller\'s written objections to
the Proposed Post-Closing Statement or the date such objections are due, and
the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be effectuated within two (2) Business Days
thereafter as provided in _Section 3.6_.  Seller and Purchaser agree to
cooperate to exchange information used to prepare the Post-Closing Statement
and information relating thereto. If Seller objects to the Proposed Post-
Closing Adjustment, the Parties shall attempt to resolve such dispute by
negotiation, and to the extent the Parties are unable to resolve any such
dispute, then the disputed portion of the Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment
shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.6_.

  

 ** Section 3.6 Procedures for Certain Purchase Price
Adjustments**. If circumstances exist that result in any disagreement in
respect of an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions of
the Adjustment Sections, then and in any such event, such negotiations, and
the resolution of disagreements, shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.6_. The Parties shall negotiate such
adjustment of the Purchase Price in good faith prior to the date such
adjustment is otherwise scheduled to become effective (each, a " _Scheduled
Adjustment Date_ "). If the Parties are unable to agree upon an adjustment
by the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to such date, then such Scheduled
Adjustment Date (but not the Closing Date or the Termination Date) shall be
extended to the fifth (5th) Business Day following completion of the
procedure described in this _Section 3.6_ and the determination of the
pertinent adjustment, to provide for the opportunity to resolve such
disagreement pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.6_. Within seven
(7) Business Days following the original Scheduled Adjustment Date, each
Party shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm in writing, its
proposed adjustments of the Purchase Price which were to occur on such
Scheduled Adjustment Date. Such proposals shall be materially in accordance
with the last proposals made by such Party to the other Party during the
course of the aforementioned good faith negotiations between the Parties.
The Parties shall additionally submit such memoranda, arguments, briefs
and evidence in support of their respective positions, and in accordance with
such procedures, as the Independent Accounting Firm may determine. Within
five (5) Business Days following the due date of such submissions, as to
each adjustment of the Purchase Price that was to occur on the Scheduled
Adjustment Date concerning which there exists disagreement, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall select, on an individual basis, a proposed adjustment
of the Purchase Price proposed by one of the Parties, it being agreed that
the Independent Accounting Firm shall have no authority to alter any such
proposal in any way. Such determination by the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding between the Parties as to such adjustments of the
Purchase Price and shall not be subject to further challenge by the Parties
pursuant to _Section 11.8_ or otherwise. Upon the determination of the
appropriate adjustments, the Parties shall, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, effectuate such adjustments by including them
in the payments to occur at the Closing or, if such adjustments result in
payments being due from one Party to the other after the Closing, by the
Party from whom such payment is due delivering the payment to the other Party
no later than two (2) Business Days after such determination, in immediately
available funds or in any other manner as reasonably requested by the payee,
together with interest thereon from the Scheduled Adjustment Date to the date
of payment at a variable rate of interest equal to the "prime rate" as
published in The Wall Street Journal from time to time during the applicable
period. Subject to the foregoing, the Independent Accounting Firm may
determine the issues in dispute following such procedures, consistent with
the provisions of this Agreement, as it deems appropriate to the
circumstances and with reference to the amounts in issue. The

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

Parties do not intend to impose any particular procedures upon the
Independent Accounting Firm, it being the desire of the Parties that any such
disagreement shall be resolved as expeditiously and inexpensively as
reasonably practicable. The Independent Accounting Firm shall have no
liability to the Parties in connection with services, except for acts of bad
faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence and the Parties shall provide
such indemnities to the Independent Accounting Firm as it may
reasonably request consistent with the foregoing. The fees and disbursements
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-
half by Purchaser.

  

 ** Section 3.7 Allocation of Purchase Price**. The Parties
will, at their own cost, file all Tax Returns consistently with the
allocation of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities to the Purchased
Assets as provided in accordance with this _Section 3.7_. The allocation of

referred to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution. For purposes of
this _Section 3.7_ and wherever the Independent Accounting Firm is retained

determine the issues in dispute following such procedures, consistent with
the provisions of this Agreement, as it deems appropriate to the
circumstances and with reference to the amounts in issue. The Parties do not
intend to impose any particular procedures upon the Independent Accounting
Firm, it being the desire of the Parties that any such disagreement shall be
resolved as expeditiously and inexpensively as reasonably practicable. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall have no liability to the Parties in
connection with such services except for acts of bad faith, willful
misconduct or gross negligence, and the Parties shall provide
such indemnities to the Independent Accounting Firm as it may reasonably
request consistent with the foregoing. The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the Parties hereto
and shall not be subject to further challenge by the Parties pursuant to
_Section 11.8_  or otherwise. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting firm shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser.
 Purchaser and Seller agree to file timely Internal Revenue Service Form
8594, if necessary, and all Tax Returns, in accordance with the Final
Allocation determined under this _Section 3.7_ and to report the Transactions
for federal Income Tax and all other Tax purposes in a manner consistent with
such allocation. Each Party agrees promptly to provide the other with
any additional information and reasonable assistance required to complete
Form 8594, if necessary, or to compute Taxes arising in connection with
(or otherwise affected by) the Transactions.

be employed pursuant to the terms of the Bidding Procedures Order and the
terms and conditions of that order are incorporated by reference and made an
integral part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. The Bidding
Procedures and related bid protections are designed to compensate Purchaser
for its efforts and agreements to date and to facilitate a full and fair
process designed to maximize the value of the Purchased Assets for the

definitive agreement for the purchase of the Purchased Assets on terms
acceptable to Seller and its creditor constituencies, (ii) the execution of

definitive agreement for the purchase of the Purchased Assets on terms
acceptable to Seller and its creditor constituencies, (iii) Purchaser would
not be willing to enter into this Agreement without the protections afforded
to it pursuant to the Bidding Procedures, including the Liquidated Damages,

value of Seller\'s bankruptcy estate.

Seller will timely prepare and file, to the extent required by applicable Law, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and timely pay the amount shown as due on such Tax Returns to the applicable Governmental Authority. Purchaser will be entitled to review such returns a reasonable period in advance of filing, not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns, and such Tax Returns shall be subject to Purchaser\'s approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns, Purchaser shall pay to Seller one-half of the amount shown as due on such Tax Returns, as approved by Purchaser or, in the event of a dispute, determined in accordance with this Agreement. To the extent required by applicable Law, but subject to such review and approval, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation. To the extent this transaction is a sale of tangible personal property (corporeal movables), Purchaser and Seller intend for this sale to qualify as an isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal property pursuant to La.

Purchaser\'s preparation of any such Tax Returns shall be subject to Seller\'s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall make such Tax Returns available for Seller\'s review and approval no later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, it being understood that Seller\'s failure to approve any such Tax Returns shall not limit Purchaser\'s obligation to timely file such Tax Returns and duly and timely pay all Taxes shown to be due thereon. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of any such Taxes, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount shown as due on such Tax Returns as determined in accordance with _Section 3.4_ of this Agreement to be the responsibility of Seller and to the extent required by Law, Seller shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

  

 (c)  With respect to prorated Property Taxes to be paid by Seller, Seller\'s preparation of any Tax Return relating to a lien for Property Taxes on or related to the Purchased Assets that will arise after the Closing Date shall be subject to Purchaser\'s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller shall make such Tax Returns available for Purchaser\'s review and approval no later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, it being understood that 

   **EXECUTION VERSION**

  

Purchaser\'s failure to approve any such Tax Return shall not limit Seller\'s
obligation to timely file such Tax Returns and duly and timely pay all Taxes
shown to be due thereon. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
due date of any such Taxes, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount shown as
due on such Tax Returns as determined in accordance with _Section 3.4_  of
this Agreement to be the responsibility of Purchaser and to the
extent required by Law, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall join in the

Returns, the Parties shall cooperate and act in good faith to resolve any
disagreement related to such Tax Returns as between the Parties or as between
either Party and any Governmental Authority.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, each Party (and each of its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and other representatives) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to or otherwise obtained or prepared by or on behalf of such Party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.

  

 (e)  Any refund or rebate of Taxes paid or payable with respect to Taxes attributable to any of the Purchased Assets shall be promptly paid as follows (or to the extent payable but not paid due to offset against other Taxes shall be promptly paid by the Party receiving the benefit of the offset as follows): (i) to Seller if attributable to Taxes with respect to any Tax year or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the extent allocable to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date); and (ii) to Purchaser if attributable to Taxes with respect to any Tax year or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date (or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the extent allocable to the portion of such period ending after the Closing Date).

  

 (f)  In the event that a dispute arises between Seller and Purchaser as to the amount of Taxes, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute, and any amount so agreed upon shall be paid to the appropriate Party. If such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.7_ , which resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.

 (a)  From the date hereof to the Closing, all risk of loss or damage to the assets and properties included in the Purchased Assets, including the Project, shall be borne by Seller.

  

 (b)  If, before the Closing, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets, including the Project or the Project Site, becomes subject to or is threatened in writing by a competent Governmental Authority with any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly in writing of such fact, and Purchaser may elect, in its sole discretion, either to (i) require Seller upon the Closing to assign or cause to be assigned to Purchaser any claim, settlement, or proceeds thereof related to such proceeding to which Seller or any of its Affiliates may be entitled and proceed with the Transactions, or (ii) terminate this Agreement.

  

 (c)  If, before the Closing, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets, including the Project or the Project Site, is damaged or destroyed (the " _Damaged Portion_ ") (whether by fire, theft, vandalism or other casualty) in whole or in part, Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly in writing of such fact. If the Damaged Portion could reasonably be expected to be fully repaired or restored, in accordance with Accepted Electrical Practices, on or before the Termination Date for an estimated cost not exceeding an amount equal to the sum of $5,000,000 and proceeds from Project Insurance Policies in respect of such Damaged Portion, Seller shall bear the costs of and responsibility for fully repairing or restoring the Damaged Portion by the Termination Date, delay the Closing for such reasonable time as is necessary to accomplish the same, but in no event later than the Termination Date, and promptly commence and diligently pursue such repair or restoration. **** Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) cooperate with Purchaser, (ii) include Purchaser in meetings and communications relating to such repair or restoration in order to enable Purchaser to evaluate the quality and sufficiency thereof, and (iii) complete such full repair or restoration on or before the Termination Date. If the cost of such repair or restoration of the Damaged Portion exceeds $1,500,000, Seller will not grant its final acceptance of any such repair or restoration without Purchaser\'s prior written consent. If, before the Closing, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets, including the Project or the Project Site, is damaged or destroyed (whether by fire, theft, vandalism or other casualty) and the Damaged Portion could not reasonably be expected to be fully repaired or restored, in accordance with Accepted Electrical Practices, on or before the Termination Date, for an estimated cost not exceeding an amount equal to the sum of $5,000,000 and proceeds from Project Insurance Policies in respect of such Damaged Portion, then Purchaser may elect, in its sole discretion, either to (x) require Seller upon the Closing to transfer or cause to be transferred to Purchaser the proceeds (or the right to the proceeds) of applicable insurance to which Seller or any of its Affiliates may be entitled and proceed with the Transactions, or (y) terminate this Agreement.

  

 ** Section 6.14 Insurance**. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, effective upon the Closing, the Project Insurance Policies shall be
terminated or modified to exclude coverage of the Purchased Assets, including
the Project, by Seller or any Affiliate thereof, and, as a result, Purchaser
shall be obligated at or

 before the Closing to obtain at its sole cost and expense replacement
insurance, including insurance required by any third party to be maintained
by or for the benefit of Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
Purchased Assets, including the Project. Purchaser further acknowledges and
agrees that Purchaser may need to provide to certain Governmental Authorities
and third parties evidence of such replacement or substitute insurance
coverage for the continued operation of the Purchased Assets, including the
Project, following the Closing. If requested by Seller, Purchaser shall use
its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to assist Seller, at Seller\'s cost, in
obtaining so-called "tail" coverage in respect of claims brought after the
Closing for events occurring prior to the Closing, including, if appropriate,
listing Seller as an additional insured or named insured in policies of
Purchaser.

time or from time to time after the Closing, each Party will, upon
the reasonable request of the other Party, execute and deliver any
further instruments or documents, and exercise Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to take such further actions as may reasonably be required, to
fulfill and implement the terms of this Agreement or realize the benefits
intended to be afforded hereby. After the Closing, and upon prior reasonable
request, each Party shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cooperate with the other, at the requesting Party\'s expense (but including
only out-of-pocket expenses to third parties and not the costs incurred by
any Party for the wages or other benefits paid or payable to its officers,
directors or employees in furnishing assistance), in furnishing non-
privileged records, information, testimony and other assistance in connection
with any inquiries, actions, audits, proceedings or disputes involving the
Purchased Assets or any of the Parties hereto (other than in connection with
disputes between the Parties hereto) and based upon contracts, arrangements
or acts of Seller or Purchaser, which were in effect or occurred on, prior
to, or after Closing and which relate to the Purchased Assets, including,
without limitation, arranging discussions with (and calling as a witness)
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of Purchaser or
Seller.

inspections and tests, Purchaser may contact any Governmental Authority

the Purchased Assets as part of Purchaser\'s due diligence investigation with
respect to the Project. Seller hereby consents to any such contact.

  

 (b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will provide Purchaser an office at the Project reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser sufficient to accommodate two (2) individuals on a daily basis and equipped with the equipment and supplies appropriate for Purchaser\'s use thereof for the exercise of its rights pursuant to this Section and reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

  

 (c)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall provide Purchaser with access to information and personnel sufficient to allow Purchaser to assess and determine to its reasonable satisfaction the presence, scope and extent of any Environmental Conditions at the Project Site, the accuracy of Seller\'s representations and warranties in _Section 4.15_ , the status of any Remediation or otherwise.

Seller hereby consents, for the purpose of this Section and otherwise, to any such investigation provided that in no event shall Purchaser unreasonably interfere with Seller\'s operation of the Project.

During such time period after the Closing, Seller will permit Purchaser to examine and make copies, at Purchaser\'s expense, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, of Seller\'s accounting books and records retained as Excluded Assets pursuant to _Section 2.2(m)_ and any other books, records, documents or information reasonably relating to the Project not delivered to Purchaser by Seller, for any reasonable purpose.

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

 (e)  During such time period after the Closing, Purchaser will provide to Seller, at Seller\'s expense, copies of such books, records, documents and information reasonably relating to the Project and included in the Purchased Assets delivered to it by Seller, and Seller will provide to Purchaser, at Purchaser\'s expense, copies of Seller\'s accounting books and records retained as Excluded Assets pursuant to _Section 2.2(m)_ and any other books, records, documents or information reasonably relating to the Project not delivered to Purchaser by Seller, in either such case for any reasonable purpose, including any litigation now pending or hereafter commenced against the requesting Party by any Person.  Each Party will provide reasonable notice to the other Party of its need to access such books, records, documents or other information.

  

 ** Section 6.17 Use of Cleco Marks**. Cleco Marks will appear on
some of the Purchased Assets, including on signage at the Project, and on

Purchaser shall have, no right to use the Cleco Marks.  Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall have the right to use for internal purposes only manuals and

reasonably practicable after the Closing, remove the Cleco Marks from, or
otherwise appropriately modify so as to render the Cleco Marks no longer
visible on, the Purchased Assets, including signage at the Project.

  

 ** ****Section 6.18 Employee Matters**.

  

 (a)  Prior to the Closing Date, Seller will cause Guarantor, Seller, CGS or any of their Affiliates to terminate any leased employee services, temporary services or other agreements concerning or relating to Employees, Independent Contractors, or Persons performing work or services for the direct or indirect benefit of the Project, including the Operation and Maintenance Agreement between Seller and CGS, dated May 29, 2001, the WillStaff Worldwide Temporary Staffing Service Agreement between Cleco Corporation and WillStaff Worldwide Staffing dated September 4, 2001, the CT LTSA, the CCGT LTSA, and any agreements between Guarantor, Seller, CGS or any of their Affiliates and Ron Williams Construction Company.

Purchaser has no obligation to assume any employment agreements or other agreements concerning or relating to current or former Employees, Independent Contractors, or Persons performing work or services for the direct or indirect benefit of the Project. Purchaser may, in Purchaser\'s sole discretion, elect to offer employment that would not commence earlier than the next Business Day after the Closing Date to any current or former Employees or Independent Contractors on such terms and conditions as Purchaser may determine, but Purchaser shall not be obligated to do so pursuant to this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any 

   **EXECUTION VERSION**

  

other written or verbal agreement, representation or statement related to the
Transactions. Seller shall not make, and shall cause Guarantor, CGS and
their Affiliates to not make, any written or verbal agreement, representation
or statement to current or former Employees or Independent Contractors about
the possibility of employment or retention on the Project with Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates that is inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 6.18(a)_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, prior to the Closing,
upon reasonable prior notice to Seller, Purchaser may communicate with any
current or former Employee or Independent Contractor about the possibility of
employment with Purchaser. If Purchaser in its sole discretion, chooses to
offer employment to any Employee or Independent Contractor and such
individual accepts such offer, such individual shall be considered, for all
purposes, as a newly-hired employee of Purchaser. In the event Purchaser
decides to hire any former Employees of Guarantor, Seller, CGS or any of
their Affiliates, Purchaser shall notify Seller of such decision and Seller
shall cause Guarantor, Seller, CGS or any of their Affiliates that are party
to or benefited by the agreements described in this sentence to release those
employees from any provisions of the "Acknowledgement and Protection of
Confidential Information" agreements or other confidentiality agreements, or

and their former Employees with respect to matters relating to the Project,
any of the Purchased Assets or the Transactions, that may or does interfere
with the Person\'s prospective employment with Purchaser.

  

 (b)  With respect to any "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as defined by the WARN Act, its regulations or similar Law affecting any Employees or other individuals performing work or services related to or for the Project who may be legally classified as employees of Guarantor or any of its Affiliates, Seller shall cause its Affiliates to (a) comply fully with the WARN Act and its regulations and any similar applicable Law, and (b) perform and discharge the obligation, if any, to serve in a timely manner and fashion all notices required by the WARN Act, its regulations or any similar Law to Employees or other individuals performing work or services related to or for the Project who may be legally classified as employees of Guarantor or any of its Affiliates.

  

 ** ****Section 6.19 Additional Covenants of Purchaser**.
 Purchaser hereby agrees with and covenants to Seller that:

  

 (a)  Prior to consummation of the Transactions or the termination or expiration of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, unless Seller shall otherwise consent in writing, Purchaser shall not take or suffer to be taken any action which would cause any of Purchaser\'s representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE 5_ to be inaccurate or incorrect in any material respect as of the Closing; and

  

 (b)  If the Closing occurs and if, and to the extent that, the assignment to and assumption by Purchaser of the LTSAs pursuant to this Agreement effects a transfer to Purchaser of any prepayments, credits or refunds that constitute Excluded Assets, Purchaser shall promptly pay to Seller any amounts as, when and to the extent realized by Purchaser, in respect of such Excluded Asset.

  

 ** Section 6.20 Additional Covenants of Seller**.  Seller hereby

 ** Section 6.21 Waiver of Implied Warranties**.  Purchaser and its
agents, consultants and representatives have had a reasonable opportunity to
inspect the Purchased Assets. Purchaser waives all warranties and
representations imposed on Seller as a matter of law (other than the express
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement) as to the condition of the Purchased Assets, including
without limitation, the following:

  

 (a)  the warranty of fitness for intended purpose or guarantee against hidden or latent redhibitory vices under Louisiana law, including Louisiana Civil Code Articles 2520 through 2548;

  

 (b)  the warranty imposed by Louisiana Civil Code Article 2475;

Procedures Order, made as if the Bidding Procedures Order had been entered.
Seller shall not provide any non-public information with respect to Seller
and its Affiliates or the Transactions to any Person that expresses a bona
fide interest in making a bid in accordance with the terms of the Bidding
Procedures Order unless: (i) such non-public information is provided
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (with terms regarding the
protection of the confidential information at least as restrictive as the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement); and (ii) such non-public information
has been delivered or previously made available to Purchaser. Seller may not
release any Person from, or waive any provisions of, any such confidentiality
agreement to which Seller is a party.

  

 (b)  Upon receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, Seller will promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) notify Purchaser in writing and include in such notice the identity of the offeror and a complete and accurate description of the material terms and provide Purchaser with a copy of any writing evidencing such Acquisition Proposal, and thereafter keep Purchaser generally informed on a reasonably 

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

current basis of the status and terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
including, without limitation, providing Purchaser with copies of
any amendments or supplements to the Acquisition Proposal and any other
writings related to such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the terms
and conditions of the Bidding Procedures Order: Seller will not accept
an Acquisition Proposal unless Seller determines in good faith and upon the
advice of independent financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal has a
value of at least $1 million greater than: (i) the value Seller would
have received pursuant to this Agreement, plus (ii) the Break-Up Fee
(as defined in the Bidding Procedures Order). For purposes of
such determination, the liabilities to be assumed by Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated as if the Initial Purchase Price were
increased by the full face value of such liabilities.

 (i)  any breach or violation of any covenant, obligation or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement;

  

 (ii)  any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser in this Agreement in _ARTICLE 5_ , _provided_ , that for purposes of determining whether there has been a misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty and the amount of Losses sustained or incurred thereby, for purposes of this _Section 7.2(a)_ , such representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to the words "material", "materially", "Material Adverse Effect", or words of similar effect;

  

 (iii)  if the Closing occurs, the failure of Purchaser to pay, perform or discharge any of the Assumed Liabilities as and when due; 

  

 (iv)  if the Closing occurs, any Third Party Claim relating to or arising out of the ownership, operation or use of any of the Purchased Assets, including the Project or any other matter relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets (but excluding the Excluded Assets), to the extent relating to any period of time after the Closing Date; or

Hundred Thousand Dollars ($42,400,000).

  

 ** Section 7.3 Notice of Claim**.  Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and upon a receipt of notice of the assertion of a claim or of
the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding that is a Third Party
Claim against any member of the Purchaser Group or the Seller Group entitled
to indemnification under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ , respectively, such
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnitee_ ") will
promptly notify the Party against whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnitor_ ") in writing of any damage, claim, loss, liability or expense
which the Indemnitee has determined has given or could give rise to a claim
under, _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_. Such written notice is herein
referred to as a " _Notice of Claim._ " A Notice of Claim will specify, in
reasonable detail, the facts known to the Indemnitee regarding the claim.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the failure to provide (or timely
provide) a Notice of Claim will not affect the Indemnitee\'s rights
to indemnification; provided, however, the Indemnitor is not obligated to
indemnify the Indemnitee for the increased amount of any claim which would
otherwise have been payable to the extent that the increase resulted from the
failure to deliver timely a Notice of Claim.

  

 ** Section 7.4 Defense of Third Party Claims**. The
Indemnitor will defend, in good faith and at its expense, any claim or demand
set forth in a Notice of Claim relating to a Third Party Claim and the
Indemnitee, at its expense, may participate in the defense. The
Indemnitee may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim so long as the
Indemnitor is defending it in good faith. If the Indemnitor elects not to
contest a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may undertake its defense, and the
Indemnitor will be bound by the result obtained by the Indemnitee. The
Indemnitor may at any time request the Indemnitee to agree to the
abandonment of the contest of the Third Party Claim or to the payment
or compromise by the Indemnitor of the asserted claim or demand. If the
Indemnitee does not object in writing within fifteen (15) days of the
Indemnitor\'s request, the Indemnitor may proceed with the action stated in
the request. If, within that fifteen (15) day period, the Indemnitee notifies
the Indemnitor in writing that it has determined that the contest should be
continued, the Indemnitor will be liable under this _ARTICLE 7_  only for an
amount up to the amount which the Indemnitor had proposed be accepted in
payment or compromise. This _Section 7.4_  is subject to the rights of any
insurance carrier of Indemnitee that is defending the Third Party Claim.

  

 ** ** **Section 7.5 Cooperation**-64- **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

complaint against any Person. The Indemnitor will reimburse the Indemnitee
for any expenses incurred by Indemnitee in cooperating with or acting at the
request of the Indemnitor.

  

 ** Section 7.6 Mitigation and Limitation of Claims**. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Indemnifiable Claim_ " means any
Purchaser Claims or Seller Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein:

  

 (a)   _Reasonable Steps to Mitigate_. The Indemnitee will take all reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses relating to an Indemnifiable Claim, including availing itself of any defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third Persons and other rights at law or equity, and will provide such evidence and documentation of the nature and extent of the Indemnifiable Claim as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnitor.  The Indemnitee\'s reasonable steps include the reasonable expenditure of money to mitigate or otherwise reduce or eliminate any Loss for which indemnification would otherwise be due under this _ARTICLE 7_ , and the Indemnitor will reimburse the Indemnitee for the Indemnitee\'s reasonable expenditures in undertaking the mitigation, together with interest thereon from the date of payment to the date of repayment at a variable rate of interest equal to the "prime rate" as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ from time to time during the applicable period.

  

 (b)   _Limitations_. Any Indemnifiable Claim shall be limited to the amount of actual damages sustained by the Indemnitee, net of insurance recoveries, provided that a Seller Claim for a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser that results in a termination of this Agreement or other failure to consummate the Transactions may include any excess of the consideration to be received by Seller for the Purchased Assets under this Agreement over the consideration to be received by Seller from the sale of the Purchased Assets to a third Person in any subsequent transaction or over the value of the Purchased Assets if they are not subsequently sold and a Purchaser Claim for a breach of this Agreement by Seller that results in a termination of this Agreement or other failure to consummate the Transactions may include any excess of the consideration to be paid by Purchaser to a third Person in a subsequent transaction comparable to the Transactions over the consideration to be paid to Seller for the Purchased Assets under this Agreement.

  

 (c)   _Minimum Claim_. If the Closing occurs, no Party shall have any liability or obligation to indemnify under _Section 7.1(a)(ii)_ or _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ , unless and until the aggregate amount for which such Party would be liable thereunder, but for this provision, exceeds One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000), in which event recovery by the Indemnitees shall include the full aggregate amount of such liability, including such amounts as do not exceed such threshold amount.  Nothing in this _Section 7.6(c)_ is intended to modify or limit a Party\'s liability or obligation hereunder for other Indemnifiable Claims.

  

 (d)   _Time Limit for Claims_. If the Closing does not occur, claims for indemnification under this _ARTICLE 7_ must be brought on or before the second (2nd) anniversary of the termination of this Agreement.

  

 ** Section 7.7 After-Tax Basis**.  Any and all payments
required to be made under this _ARTICLE 7_ shall be made on an After-Tax
Basis.

 ** Section 7.8 Specific Performance**.  Seller acknowledges
that the Transactions are unique and that Purchaser will be irreparably
injured should such Transactions not be consummated in a timely fashion.
Consequently, Purchaser will not have an adequate remedy at law if Seller
shall fail to sell the Purchased Assets when required to do so hereunder. In
such event, Purchaser shall have the right, in addition to any other remedy
available in equity or law, to specific performance of such obligation by
Seller, subject to Purchaser\'s performance of its obligations hereunder.

 ** Section 10.2 Effect of Termination**. If there has been a
termination pursuant to _Section 10.1_ then, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 10.3_ , this Agreement shall be deemed terminated, and all further
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate, except that the
obligations set forth in _Section 6.2_ , _Section 10.3_ and in _ARTICLE 7_
and _ARTICLE 11_ shall survive. In the event of such termination of this
Agreement, there shall be no liability for damages on the part of a Party to
another under and by reason of this Agreement except as set forth in _ARTICLE
7_ and _Section 10.3_ , and except for intentionally fraudulent acts by a
Party, the remedies for which shall not be limited by the provisions of this

the availability of specific performance or other injunctive or

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

equitable relief to the extent that specific performance or such other relief
would otherwise be available to a Party hereunder.

  

 ** Section 10.3 Liquidated Damages**. (a)  If Purchaser
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(j)_ , _Section 10.1(k)_ ,
_Section 10.1(l)_ , _Section 10.1(m)_ or _Section 10.1(o)_ or if Seller
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(n),_ the Liquidated
Damages shall become immediately due and payable by Seller and Seller shall
pay the Liquidated Damages to Purchaser within ten (10) calendar days of
Seller\'s receipt of notice of such termination (or, if later, the date on
which such notice is effective), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser. If the Liquidated
Damages shall have been paid to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the damages, expenses and other
Losses that would be incurred by Purchaser in the event of a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(j)_ ,  _Section 10.1(k)_ , _Section
10.1(l)_ , _Section 10.1(m)_ , _Section 10.1(n)_ or _Section 10.1(o)_ are
likely to be substantial and unreasonably difficult to ascertain and
calculate, (ii) the Liquidated Damages are a reasonable estimate of
Purchaser\'s actual direct damages and expenses in the event of any such
termination, (iii) payment of the Liquidated Damages in the event of any such
termination shall be deemed appropriate as liquidated damages and shall be
deemed not to be a penalty, and (iv) except to the extent, if any, that the
termination pursuant to _Section 10.1(j)_ , _Section 10.1(k)_ , _Section
10.1(l)_ , _Section 10.1(m)_ , _Section 10.1(n)_  or _Section 10.1(o)_ shall
have resulted from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of Seller,
payment of the Liquidated Damages based on a termination pursuant to _Section
10.1(j)_ , _Section 10.1(k)_ , _Section 10.1(l)_ , _Section 10.1(m)_ ,
_Section 10.1(n)_ or _Section 10.1(o)_ shall be deemed Purchaser\'s sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement following any such termination.

  

 (b)  Any Liquidated Damages payable by Seller pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any payments of such Liquidated Damages made to Purchaser by Guarantor (whether prior to or after any demand therefor), or (ii) the amount of any break-up or similar fee paid by Seller to Purchaser that is approved by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order or otherwise. To the extent that Purchaser shall have received the full amount of Liquidated Damages payable pursuant to Section 10.3(a) and shall thereafter receive any such break-up or similar fee, Purchaser will promptly refund to the payor thereof a portion of such Liquidated Damages equal to the amount of such break-up or similar fee.

  

 **ARTICLE 11 
  
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement), the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the Transactions, and supersede all negotiations,
representations, warranties, commitments, offers, contracts and writings
(except for the Confidentiality Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreements executed prior to the date hereof) prior to the execution date of
this Agreement, written or oral. No modification or amendment of any
provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and
duly signed by the Parties referring specifically to this Agreement.

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

 ** Section 11.2 Schedules**. For purposes of determining whether
Purchaser\'s conditions set forth in _Section 8.5_  have been fulfilled, the
Schedules shall be deemed to include only (i) the information contained
therein on the date of this Agreement and (ii) all information contained in
any update, supplement or amendment thereto to the extent such information
relates to periods after the as of dates of the Schedules attached to this
Agreement on the Effective Date or to the extent such information relates to
any conditions or matters that could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, but if Closing shall occur, then all matters
disclosed by either Party pursuant to any such update, supplement or
amendment at or prior to the Closing shall be deemed to be included in the
Schedules as of the Closing Date.

  

 ** Section 11.3 Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which is an original, but all of which
together constitute one and the same instrument.

  

 ** Section 11.4 Severability**. Whenever possible, each provision
of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid, binding
and enforceable under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, void (or voidable) or unenforceable under applicable
Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent held to be
invalid, void (or voidable) or unenforceable, without affecting the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. To the
extent permitted by Law, the Parties waive any provision of Law that renders
any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

  

 **Section 11.5 Assignment**. The rights under this Agreement shall
not be assignable or transferable nor the duties delegable by either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be
granted or withheld in such other Party\'s sole discretion.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser may (i) grant to its lenders a security interest in
its rights under this Agreement, (ii) assign (after Closing) its rights
hereunder to any Person or Persons acquiring the Purchased Assets, or (iii)
assign all of its rights hereunder prior to the Closing either to an
Affiliate or as otherwise may be necessary or appropriate for a lease
financing or similar financing; _provided_  that neither the grant of any
such interest, nor the foreclosure of any such interest, shall in any way
release, reduce or diminish the obligations of Purchaser to Seller hereunder.
Any assignment shall be conditioned on the assignee\'s agreement in writing
to assume the assigning Party\'s duties and obligations under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements subject to any and all restrictions, terms
and conditions of the Project Contracts. Any assignment effected
in accordance with this _Section 11.5_ will not relieve the assigning
Party of its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements or Guarantor\'s duties and obligations under the
Guaranty, as the case may be. Any purported assignment or delegation not
effected in accordance with this _Section 11.5_ shall be deemed void.

  

 ** Section 11.6 Captions**. The captions of the various Articles,
Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement have been inserted only
for convenience of reference and do not modify, explain, enlarge or restrict
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

 ** Section 11.7 Governing Law**. The validity, interpretation and
effect of this Agreement are governed by and will be construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law
doctrines (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations
Law), except to the extent that  

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

(i) certain matters are preempted by federal law or are governed by the law
of the respective jurisdictions of incorporation or formation, as applicable
of the Parties or (ii) certain matters with respect to immovable property and
to the waivers of warranty in _Section 6.21_ are governed by the law of the
State of Louisiana.

  

 ** Section 11.8 Dispute Resolution**.

  

 (a)  Except for matters covered by _Section 3.6_ , _Section 3.7_ or _Section 6.12_ , any claim, counterclaim, demand, cause of action, dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (or any agreement delivered in connection with the Transactions) or in any way relating to the subject matter of the Transactions involving any of the Parties or their representatives (each, a " _Dispute_ "), may be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration, if agreed to in writing by the Parties. 

  

 (b)  Prior to commencing arbitration of any Dispute, the Parties agree that, upon notice by either Party to the opposite Party of a Dispute, each Party shall, within three (3) Business Days, designate a senior executive officer of such Party for purposes of attempting to resolve the Dispute through review and negotiation and shall notify the opposite Party of the senior executive officer designated by it for such purpose. The two senior executive officers so designated shall meet at least once and negotiate in good faith during a period of thirty (30) days following their designation in an effort to resolve the Dispute.

  

 (c)  If any Dispute shall not have been resolved by negotiation in accordance with _Section 11.8(b)_ within the period of fifteen (15) days therein specified, the Parties may agree in writing to resolve the Dispute by final and binding arbitration. If the Parties do not so agree to resolve the Dispute, each Party shall have and shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. Arbitration pursuant to this Agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ") as in effect at the time of the arbitration (the " _Rules_ "). The validity, construction and interpretation of this Agreement to arbitrate, and all other procedural aspects of the arbitration conducted pursuant hereto shall be decided by the arbitrators in accordance with the Rules. The arbitrators shall have no authority to award treble, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances whether or not such damages may be available under state or federal law, or under the Commercial Rules of the AAA, the Parties hereby waiving their right, if any, to recover any such damages or to appeal or object to the enforcement of any decision or award by the arbitrators. Each Party agrees that any arbitration award against it may be enforced in any jurisdiction in which such Party holds or keeps assets and that judgment on any arbitration award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in New Orleans, Louisiana.

  

 (d)  Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice by one Party of initiation of an arbitration proceeding, Seller and Purchaser shall each select one (1) arbitrator and the two selected arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. If the arbitrators selected by the Parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA in accordance with the listing, ranking and striking procedure in the Rules.

Party and does not have a direct or indirect interest in either Party or in
any Person having an ownership interest in either Party or the subject
matter of the arbitration.

  

 (e)  In deciding the substance of the Parties\' Dispute, the arbitrators shall refer to the governing law referenced in this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any arbitration proceeding and the arbitrators\' award shall be maintained in confidence by the Parties.

  

 (f)  The costs of the arbitration proceedings, other than the Parties\' own expenses, shall be shared equally by the Parties.

  

 (g)  The arbitrators shall have no power to amend or add to this Agreement, but shall have the authority to interpret the language of this Agreement and make findings of fact, order specific performance and provide injunctive relief and/or damages as if the arbitrators were a court. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding. 

  

 (h)  By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment, or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a court, the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect the arbitral tribunal\'s order to that effect.

  

 Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that process or summons may be served on it by mailing a copy of such process or summons to it at its address set forth, and in the manner provided for the giving of notice, in _Section 11.9_. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue, prior to the Closing, of the Bankruptcy Court, and, after the Closing, of any New York State or Federal Court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, County of New York, New York, and any appellate court from any court thereof, in any Dispute or any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with any Dispute or for the recognition or enforcement of any arbitration award or judgment. EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT (i) THE DEFENSE OF LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION, FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR ANY SIMILAR DEFENSE WITH RESPECT TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, COUNTY OF NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AND (ii) THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

like notice to the other Party.

  

 ** Section 11.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries**. Except as may be
specifically set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, is intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement on any Person other than the Parties, their
respective permitted successors and assigns, and any Person benefiting from
the indemnities provided herein, nor is anything in this Agreement intended
to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any third Persons to
any Party, nor give any third Persons any right of subrogation or action
against any Party.

  

 ** Section 11.11 No Joint Venture**. Nothing contained in this
Agreement creates or is intended to create an association, trust,
partnership, or joint venture or impose a trust or partnership duty,
obligation, or liability on or with regard to any Party.

  

 ** Section 11.12  Construction of Agreement**. This Agreement and any
documents or instruments delivered pursuant hereto shall be construed without
regard to the identity of the Person who drafted the various provisions of
the same.  Each and every provision of this Agreement and such other
documents and instruments shall be construed as though the Parties
participated equally in the drafting of the same. Consequently, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that any rule of construction that a document is to be
construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable either to this
Agreement or such other documents and instruments.

  

 ** Section 11.13 Waiver of Compliance**. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, any failure to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition set forth herein or in any Ancillary Agreement, or any
breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein or in any Ancillary
Agreement, or any other event or circumstance which, with or without the
giving of

  

notice or the passage of time or both, gives rise to a right of termination
hereunder, may be waived by the Party entitled to the benefit of such
obligation, covenant, agreement, condition, representation or warranty or
right of termination only by a written instrument signed by such Party that
expressly waives, under or for purposes of this Agreement, such failure or
breach or the occurrence or existence of any such other event
or circumstance, but any such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any prior or subsequent failure to comply therewith
or breach thereof. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, or the waiver of the fulfillment of any such
condition, will not affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based
on such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.  The failure of a
Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

   **EXECUTION VERSION**  

  

 ** Section 11.14 Survival; Right to Indemnification Not Affected by
Knowledge**.

  

 (a)  The representations and warranties given or made by any Party in _Articles 4 or 5_ hereof or in any certificate or other writing furnished in connection herewith shall survive the Closing for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date and shall thereafter terminate and be of no further force or effect, except that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.12_ shall not survive past the Closing Date and shall terminate upon the Closing (ii) all representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.1_ , _Section 4.2_ , _Section 4.3_ ,  _Section 4.9_ , _Section 4.10_ , _Section 4.11_ , _Section 4.14_ ,  _Section 5.1_ , _Section 5.2_ , _Section 5.3_ or _Section 5.5_  shall survive the Closing for a period of ten (10) years after the Closing Date, and (iii) any representation or warranty as to which a third-party claim or a good-faith claim by a Party (including a contingent claim) shall have been asserted during the survival period shall continue in effect with respect to such claim until such claim shall have been finally resolved or settled.

  

 (b)  The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement, including those set forth in ARTICLE 7 and _Section 10.3_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely, unless otherwise specified herein. The survival period of the covenant set forth in _Section 6.4(k)_ for purposes of any claim for damages for breach of such covenant shall be limited as if the breach of the covenant were the breach of the representation or warranty which the Seller\'s actions have caused to be untrue.

  

 (c)  The representations and warranties of the Parties set forth herein, subject to the express exceptions thereto, and the representations and warranties of Guarantor set forth in the Guaranty, shall not be affected by any information furnished to, or any investigation or audit conducted before or after the Effective Date or the Closing Date by, any of the Parties or their respective representatives in connection with the Transactions. Each Party shall be entitled to rely upon the representations and warranties of the other Party set forth herein and, in the case of Purchaser, the representations and warranties of Guarantor set forth in the Guaranty, notwithstanding any investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing Date or the decision of any Party to complete the Closing. The right to indemnification or other remedy based on any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements will not be affected by any investigation or audit conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to 

  

the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation.
