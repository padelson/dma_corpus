to be employed with respect to this Agreement concerning the sale of the
Purchased Assets to Purchaser shall be employed pursuant to the terms of the
Bidding Procedures Order and the terms and conditions of that order are
incorporated by reference and made an integral part of this Agreement as if
fully set forth herein.&nbsp; The Bidding Procedures and related bid
protections are designed to compensate Purchaser for its efforts and agreements
to date and to facilitate a full and fair process designed to maximize the
value of the Purchased Assets for the benefit of Seller's bankruptcy
estate.&nbsp; In particular, Seller acknowledges and agrees that (i) no other party to date has been willing to
enter into a definitive agreement for the purchase of the Purchased Assets on
terms acceptable to Seller and its creditor constituencies, (ii) the execution
of this Agreement by Purchaser is a necessary prerequisite to determining
whether any party other than Purchaser is willing to enter into a definitive
agreement for the purchase of the Purchased Assets on terms acceptable to
Seller and its creditor constituencies, (iii) Purchaser would not be willing to
enter into this Agreement without the protections afforded to it pursuant to
the Bidding Procedures, including the Liquidated Damages, and (iv) as a result,
such protections are expenses necessary to maximize the value of Seller's
bankruptcy estate.</p>
