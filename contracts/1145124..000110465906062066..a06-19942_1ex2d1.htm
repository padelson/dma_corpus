Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

and converted automatically into the right to receive the Common Per Share

Capital Stock_ "), will be converted automatically into the right to receive
the Series B Consideration (as defined herein) and (iv) each Stock Option
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the applicable
Option Consideration (as defined herein). Each holder of a certificate
representing any such Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to this Article I
and Article VII, the applicable consideration to be paid upon surrender of
such certificate in accordance with Section 1.13 hereof.

  

(b) The " _Common Per Share Consideration_ " shall equal, per share of
Company Common Stock, $130.109276 in cash (subject to any adjustments made
pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof) and 14.621796 fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of Parent (" _Parent Common

Section 1.8 hereof) and 14.621799 fully paid and

       

nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock, payable to the holder thereof,
without interest and less any withholding taxes.

  

(e) The " _Merger Consideration_ " shall equal the aggregate of (i) the
Series A Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Series A
Preferred issued and outstanding as of the date hereof, (ii) the Series B
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Series B Preferred issued
and outstanding as of the date hereof, (iii) the Common Per Share
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares (excluding the shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7) of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the date hereof, (iv) the Option Consideration (as defined
in Section 1.10) and (v) the Additional Consideration (as defined in Section

split, stock dividend, combination or recapitalization of the Parent Common
Stock following the date hereof.

  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 1.8(b) and (c), in
no event shall the Merger Consideration exceed $170,000,000 in cash and,
subject to Section 1.6(f), 19,104,762 shares of Parent Common Stock), plus
(x) the aggregate amount of all cash dividends, distributions and payments
paid to the securityholders of the Company pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(ii)
after the date hereof but on or prior to the Closing Date, plus (y) the
Additional Consideration.

  

Section 1.7. _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_ _._ Each share of the
Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Company, if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

Section 1.8. _Working Capital Adjustment_ _._

  

(a) Set forth in Section 1.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule is the
Companys good faith estimate of the working capital (" _Estimated Working
Capital_ ") of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, subject to accounting principles, methodologies, procedures and
classifications as set forth in Section 1.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (" _Company s Statement_"), and copies of all documentary evidence
reasonably necessary or helpful to substantiate such calculation. Parent
shall have an opportunity to fully investigate and substantiate the Companys
Statement for a period of 90 days, during which period Parent and its agents
shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the books and records, the financial systems and
finance personnel and any other relevant information of the Company to the
extent reasonably necessary to review the Companys Statement, and the
Company agrees to promptly and fully cooperate in any such process as
reasonably requested by Parent. If Parent agrees in writing with the
Companys estimate, such estimate shall be the " _Final Working Capital_." If
Parent contests such estimate, the parties shall discuss and negotiate in
good faith to resolve any dispute and agree upon the Final Working Capital.
If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute by the Closing Date, the
matter will be submitted for resolution to a nationally-recognized
independent public accounting firm reasonably satisfactory to both Parent and
the Company (the " _Neutral Firm_ "), and the Closing Date will be delayed but
in no event later than the End Date (as defined herein) pending resolution of
the dispute. The Neutral Firm shall determine the Final Working Capital as of
the date hereof. The determination by the Neutral Firm shall be binding on
both parties. The Company agrees to provide the Neutral Firm all
reasonable cooperation and access to books and records and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The fees and disbursements of the Neutral Firm
shall be allocated equally between Parent and the Company. The Estimated
Working Capital and Final Working Capital shall have the meaning and be
calculated in accordance with Section 1.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

       

(b) If the Final Working Capital as of the date hereof, as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.8, exceeds the sum of (i) $5,000,000, plus (ii)
the aggregate amount of all cash dividends, distributions and payments paid
to the securityholders of the Company pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(ii) after
the date hereof but on or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall pay to the
Paying Agent the aggregate amount of such excess in accordance with Section
1.13 hereof and such excess shall be considered to be part of the Merger
Consideration. If the Final Working Capital as of the date hereof, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.8, is less than the sum of (i)
$5,000,000, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all cash dividends
and distributions paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Section 4.1(c)(ii) after the date hereof but on or prior to the Closing Date,
then the Merger Consideration payable by Parent pursuant to Section 1.13
shall be reduced by such deficit.

  

(c) In the event that the Merger Consideration is increased or decreased
because of adjustments made pursuant to Section 1.8, such increase or
decrease shall be allocated ratably among the Series A Consideration, Series
B Consideration and Common Per Share Consideration, as applicable, and any
reference to the Common Per Share Consideration, the Series A Consideration
or the Series B Consideration shall be deemed to mean such defined term as
adjusted by this Section 1.8.

  

Section 1.9. _Dissenting Shares_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if any Stockholder shall demand to be paid the
"fair value" of such holders shares of Company Common Stock, as provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL (such Stockholder a " _Dissenting Stockholder_
"), such shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration except as
provided in this Section 1.9, and the Company shall give Parent notice
thereof and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Neither the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall
thereupon be treated as though such shares had been converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6. Parent shall contribute or cause to be
contributed to the Surviving Corporation funds sufficient from time to time
to make all payments with respect to the Dissenting Shares.

  

Section 1.10. _Stock Options_ _._

  

(a) Each Stock Option (as defined herein) that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, and that is not then
vested and exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable on an
accelerated basis immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the
Effective Time and in accordance with the terms of the Stock Option Plan (as
defined herein), each Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for
the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation consideration
(the aggregate of such payments being the " _Option Consideration_ ") equal to
the difference of (i) the product of (x) the excess (if any) of (A) the
Common Per Share Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock for such Stock Option times (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Stock Option, minus (ii) applicable
withholding taxes, minus (iii) the portion of the Escrow Fund to be deposited
in the Escrow Fund on such holders behalf pursuant to Section 1.13(c). Each
holder of Stock Options cancelled in accordance with this Section 1.10(a)
shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, other than the right to receive the stock and cash payment pursuant
to this Section 1.10(a) attributable to such cancelled Stock Option. The
Option Consideration issued to each holder of Stock Options cancelled in
accordance with this Section 1.10(a) shall be in the same proportion of cash
and Parent Common Stock as issued to a holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.6(a).

       

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) take all lawful and
commercially reasonable actions (including, without limitation, obtaining all
necessary consents and waivers from the holders of Stock Options) necessary
to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 1.10(a) and (ii)
take all lawful and commercially reasonable actions necessary such that, on
and after the Effective Time, the Stock Option Plan shall be cancelled, the
Stock Options shall cease to represent the right to purchase Company Common
Stock and no Stock Option holder shall have any right or option to purchase
Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, Parent, or
the Surviving Corporation (in each case, without the creation of any
additional liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

  

(c) A " _Stock Option_ " is any option or warrant to purchase Company Common
Stock granted under any stock option plan or other equity-related plan of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to employees, directors or consultants,
including options issued under the Companys 2000 Stock Option and Grant Plan
adopted June 30, 2000, as amended (the " _Stock Option Plan_ "), whether
vested or not.

  

Section 1.11. _Additional Consideration_ _._

  

(a) If the Trading Price of the Parent Common Stock is less than $8.75 as of
any Freely Transferable Date, Parent shall promptly issue, to each
Stockholder (or permitted transferee thereof) holding Parent Common Stock,
for each share of Parent Common Stock held by such holder that is then
becoming Freely Transferable, an additional fractional share of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of (i) 40.68%, multiplied by (ii) the excess of
$8.75 over the Trading Price, divided by (iii) the Trading Price. The
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to each such
holder shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

  

(b) (i) "Trading Price" shall mean the average closing bid price, weighted
by daily trading volume, both numbers as reported by NASDAQ, during the
twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Freely
Transferable Date. For purposes of this Section 1.11, if the "Trading Price"
is less than $8.00 then it shall be deemed to be $8.00.

  

(ii) "Freely Transferable", in respect of any particular share of Parent
Common Stock received as Merger Consideration, shall mean that the transfer
restrictions set forth in Section 2.1 of the Stockholders Agreement are no
longer applicable.

  

(iii) "Freely Transferable Date" shall mean, (x) in respect of Persons other
than Tom Sosnoff and Scott Sheridan, the date that is six months after the
Effective Date (or such later date when a Form S-3 shelf registration
statement is first effective with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
received by such Persons as Merger Consideration) and (y) in respect of Tom
Sosnoff and Scott Sheridan, each of the first and second anniversaries of the
Effective Date as to 35% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
constituting a portion of the Merger Consideration received by them and the
third anniversary thereof as to 30% of the number of such shares (or in each
case such later date when a Form S-3 shelf registration statement is first
effective with respect to such percentage of shares of Parent Common Stock
received by such Persons as Merger Consideration).

  

(c) On or prior to any Freely Transferable Date, Parent shall deliver a
statement to each Stockholder holding Parent Common Stock then becoming
Freely Transferable with details of the calculation of the "Trading Price"
and the number of additional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, each
Stockholder will be issued as Additional Consideration.

  

Section 1.12. _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_ _._ Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub _("Merger Sub Common Stock")_
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall thereafter
constitute all of the issued and

       

outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, all of which will be
owned by Parent. Each stock certificate representing any shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall continue after the Effective Time to represent ownership
of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 1.13. _ Surrender and Exchange of Certificates_ _._

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the
Paying Agent in the Merger.

  

(b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration_. When and as needed, Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock, at or prior to the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.8), less the amount
to be deposited into an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to
Section 1.13(c). Parent agrees to make available to the Paying Agent, from
time to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.13(i) and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.13(j). At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, all cash and certificates deposited with or made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 1.13(b), which remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates representing shares of
Company Capital Stock, shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
thereafter such holders of unexchanged shares of Company Capital Stock shall
be entitled to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration for payment upon due surrender of their Certificates.

  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed or delivered to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that represented as of
the Effective Time outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock to be
exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6, a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify, including acknowledgement of the provisions of Article
VII) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration therefor. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) one or more shares of Parent
Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.6 (after taking into account all shares of Company Capital Stock
then held by such holder) and (ii) a check for the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration represented by such Certificate (less the portion of the Escrow
Fund to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holders behalf pursuant to
this Section 1.13(c)). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration or pursuant to
Section 1.13(i) or Section 1.13(j). The Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. At the Effective Time, and subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Article VII, Parent shall pay to the
escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") on behalf
of the Stockholders, the Escrow Amount, which shall be held by the Escrow
Agent as nominee for the Stockholders. The Escrow Fund shall be beneficially
owned by such Stockholders and shall be held in escrow and shall be available
to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons as provided in Article VII.

  

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Fund shall be
treated as an installment obligation for purposes of Section 453 of the Code,
and no party shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with
such characterization. The parties further agree that, consistent with
Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8, for Tax reporting purposes,
all interest or other income earned

       

from the investment of the Escrow Fund or any portion thereof in any Tax year
(including capital gains and losses) shall be reported as allocated to Parent
until the distribution of the Escrow Fund (or portions thereof) is determined
and thereafter to Parent and the Stockholders in accordance with their
respective interests in the Escrow Fund consistent with Proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.468B-8. The parties hereby agree that Parent shall be
entitled to an annual distribution from the Escrow Fund on the last business
day of the year (in the manner specifically provided in the Escrow Agreement)
in an amount equal to 40% of the interest and other income (including capital
gains and losses) earned from all or a portion of the Escrow Fund which is
reported by the Escrow Agent as allocated to Parent.

  

(e) _Escrow Amount_. The " _Escrow Amount_ " shall be equal to the sum
of (i) $8,000,000 in cash, plus (ii) $400,000, as the estimated amount
of court costs and legal fees to be incurred after the Effective Time
in connection with the Litigations set forth in Section 7.3(a)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, plus (iii) when and if available in cash to the
Surviving Corporation, the net cash proceeds received in connection with
such Litigations, plus (iv) when and if available in cash to the
Surviving Corporation, the amount of the federal income Tax refund
attributable to the carryback created by the expenses relating to Stock
Options granted under the Stock Option Plan (or any predecessor plan).

  

(f) _Payment to Registered Holders_. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition to such payment that (i) the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the
Person requesting such exchange will have paid any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of such payment in a name other than the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered or established to the satisfaction of Parent,
or any agent designated by Parent, that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

  

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to a holder of a Certificate for any amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to
five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority),
any Merger Consideration or other shares, cash, dividends, distributions or
other things of value in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person, whether
previously entitled thereto or not.

  

(h) _Withholding of Tax_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Capital Stock
such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall determine
in good faith they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended from time to time (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated
and rulings issued thereunder, or any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Laws relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Capital Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

(i) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock._

  

(i) No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of the same
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock.

       

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock multiplied by (ii) $9.00. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Paying Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit such amount with the Paying
Agent and shall cause the Paying Agent to forward payments to such holders of
fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

(j) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate (of Company Capital Stock) that such holder
would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate until such
holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section 1.13(c).
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record and payment date after the Effective Time but
prior to such surrender, payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

Section 1.14. _Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_ _._ The
applicable Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article I (including
amounts paid into the Escrow Fund pursuant to Article VII) shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Capital Stock (including any rights to receive accumulated but undeclared
dividends on such Company Capital Stock, if any). At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital
Stock on the records of the Surviving Corporation. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing ownership of
shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock (including any rights to
receive accumulated but undeclared dividends on such Company Capital Stock,
if any) except as otherwise provided for herein. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

  

Section 1.15. _Closing_ _._ Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned
pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, and subject to the provisions of
Article V, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at
10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") to be mutually
agreed upon by the parties, which date shall be not later than the third
Business Day after all the conditions set forth in Article V shall have been
satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 6.5), unless another time
and/or date is agreed by the parties hereto. The Closing shall take place at
the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York or such other place as the parties hereto otherwise agree.

Section 1.16. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_ _._ In the event
any Certificates representing Company Capital Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an acceptable affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof and the delivery of such other documents
reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the applicable
Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however,_  that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 4.2. _No Solicitation of Other Proposals_.

  

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the

class of the outstanding capital stock or voting power of the Company or such
Subsidiary, (iv) the sale, lease, exchange, license (whether exclusive or
not), assignment, transfer or other disposition of a substantial portion of
the Intellectual Property or a substantial portion of the business or other
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (v) any other transaction, the
consummation of which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or which would reasonably be expected to diminish significantly the
benefits to Parent or its Affiliates of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and all Company Representatives to immediately
terminate and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall take all reasonable actions to ensure that each Company Representative

foregoing, any action or conduct by any Affiliate or Subsidiary of the
Company or any Company Representative that would be a violation of this

any Subsidiary to enter, into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar Contract or instrument
related to any Acquisition Proposal, or (5) resolve or announce its intention
to do any of the foregoing.

  

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 4.2, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing
upon the receipt of any request for information with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could result in
an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the
same.

  

Section 4.3. _Stockholders Consents_. Each Stockholder that holds shares
representing 3% or more of the outstanding shares of any class or series of
Company Capital Stock (but, in the aggregate, in no event less than 90% of
the outstanding shares of each applicable class or series of Company Capital
Stock) has executed and delivered in the Voting Agreement, in accordance with
Section 228 of the DGCL, the Stockholder Consents. The Stockholder Consents

all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned beneficially or of record
by such Stockholders or as to which they have, directly or indirectly, the
right to vote or direct the voting.

provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

       

(b) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to Parents stockholders as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof.

  

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto
and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Parent.

  

Section 4.5. _Stockholders Meeting_. Parent shall duly take all lawful
and commercially reasonable action to call, give notice of, convene and hold

of obtaining Parent stockholder approvals (the " _Parent
Stockholder Approvals_ ") with respect to (i) the issuance of the
Stock Consideration and (ii) the amendment to Parents certificate
of incorporation reasonably satisfactory to the Company sufficient to permit
the issuance of the Stock Consideration and the granting of options to
the management of the Company, and shall take all lawful and
commercially reasonable action to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approvals.

agents of the other party (Parent and the Company) (collectively "
_Party Representatives_ ") full access, during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all its properties, records, databases, source code,
books, Contracts, commitments and other information (however stored) and,
during such period, such party shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party all such information as
the other party may reasonably request. Each party shall (and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to) make available to the other party the
appropriate individuals for discussion of such entitys business, properties
and personnel as the other party or the other partys Party Representatives
may reasonably request. No investigation pursuant to this Section 4.6(a)
shall affect any representations or warranties of the parties herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent all financial information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including (i) as soon as practicable but in any event no later than
30 days after the end of any fiscal quarter of such party, financial
statements of the Company for such fiscal quarter which have been reviewed by
the Companys independent accountants, and (ii) as soon as practicable but in
any event no later than 10 days after the end of each calendar month,
financial statements of the Company for such calendar month. On or prior to
September 30, 2006, the Company shall deliver to Parent audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company as of and for the quarter and six months
ending June 30, 2006, which are substantially similar to the unaudited
consolidated financial statements as of and for such periods as set forth in
Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

(b) Each party shall keep all non-public information obtained pursuant to

Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company and
Parent hereby agree that each such party may issue press release(s) or make
other public announcements in accordance with Section 4.10.

       

Section 4.7. _Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.

and cooperate with the other party or parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in an expeditious
manner, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and the
Related Agreements. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) as promptly as practicable, obtain all Approvals
(including those referred to in Sections 2.5(a), 2.5(b) and 3.5(b) and set
forth in Sections 2.5(a) and 2.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
Section 3.5(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule) necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements, (ii)
make all filings required under applicable Law, required in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
and Parent and the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, (iii) furnish all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable
Foreign Competition Law or any other Law or any applicable Regulations of
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Related Agreements, and (iv) obtain the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period and any required clearances
under any applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall
be under any obligation to, nor, without Parents prior written consent,
shall the Company or any Subsidiary, (A) make proposals, execute, agree or
consent to or carry out agreements or voluntarily submit to Orders (1)
providing for the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through
the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of
assets of Parent, any of its Affiliates, including its Subsidiaries, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, which assets or categories of assets, in the
aggregate, would reasonably be deemed as material to the business of either
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the holding separate of any capital stock
of any such Person, or imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the
ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to own such assets or to acquire,
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of capital stock of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, or (2) imposing or seeking to impose (x) any limitation
whatsoever on the business activities of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (y) any limitation on the
business activities of the Company or its Subsidiaries which, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent, might result in a limitation of the benefit
expected to be derived by Parent as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby or might adversely affect Parent or any of Parents Affiliates,
including its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B)
otherwise take any step to avoid or eliminate any impediment which may be
asserted or requested under any Law. Neither party hereto will knowingly take
any action which results in any of the representations or warranties made by
such party pursuant to Articles II or III, as the case may be, becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect.

  

(b) In connection with any of the filings or efforts listed in clauses (i)
through (iv) of Section 4.7(a), Parent and the Company will
reasonably cooperate with each other, including furnishing each other any
information reasonably requested by the other, providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filings and, if
requested, will accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith. Each party shall promptly notify the other
party of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permit the other party and its advisors to review in advance
any proposed communication to any Governmental Authority. No party to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry regarding
this Agreement, the Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby unless such party consults with the other parties in
advance, except where it is not feasible or reasonably practicable to do so.
To the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, each

       

party agrees to give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at any such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
the parties to this Agreement will provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between them or any of their
representatives or advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement,
the Related Agreements, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

(c) The parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent that are set
forth in Article V, as applicable to each of them, and to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated. Each party
hereto, at the reasonable request of another party hereto, shall execute and
deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things
as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 4.8. _Notification of Certain Matters; Certain Consents_.

  

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which results in any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement being untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect (or, in the case of any representation or warranty qualified
by its terms by materiality, then untrue or inaccurate in any respect) and
any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
4.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
Approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with this

communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the Related Agreements, (iii) any Litigation,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party that relates to
this Agreement, the Merger or the Related Agreements, or (iv) any fact,
event, change, development, circumstance, condition or effect that is
reasonably likely to delay or impede the ability of such party to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Related Agreements or
to fulfill their respective obligations set forth herein or therein.

  

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence of a
default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
material default under any Material Contract of the Company, (ii) any fact,
event, change, development, circumstance, condition or effect that could
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (iii)
any of its representations or warranties contained herein failing to be true
and correct in all material respects.

  

(d) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) any fact, event,
change, development, circumstance, condition or effect that could reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (ii) any of
its representations or warranties contained herein failing to be true and
correct in all material respects.

  

(e) The Company shall give (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to give) any
notices to third Persons, and use, and cause its Subsidiaries to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents or Approvals from
third Persons (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) otherwise required under
any Contracts in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by any Related Agreement or (iii) required to prevent
a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring. If the Company shall fail
to obtain any such Approval from a third Person, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and will take any

       

such actions reasonably requested by Parent (and Parent agrees to cooperate
therewith as reasonably requested), to limit the adverse effect upon the
Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which would result after the Effective Time, from
the failure to obtain such consent.

  

Section 4.9. _Public Announcements_. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall mutually agree on the form and
timing of an initial joint press release to be issued regarding this
Agreement. Parent and the Company shall consult with and obtain the approval
of the other party before issuing any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue
any such press release prior to such consultation and approval, except as may
be required by Law or the Regulations of any national securities exchange or
national automated quotation system, in which case the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its best
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such
press release or making any such public announcement.

  

Section 4.10. _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute or other anti-
takeover Regulation, charter provision or Contract is or shall become
applicable to the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Related Agreements, the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company
shall grant such Approvals and take such actions as are necessary under such
Laws and provisions so that the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and thereby without adverse effect under, and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of, such Law, provision or Contract.

  

Section 4.11. _Shareholder Approval of Certain Payments_. As soon
as practicable following the date hereof, but in all cases prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall (i) seek approval of its shareholders in a
manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1, which shall include adequate written disclosure
prior to a vote of all persons entitled to vote thereon (the " _Company
Shareholder Approval_"), of all payments and benefits, including those
referenced in Section 2.12(f) of this Agreement and Section 2.12(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, which would constitute "parachute
payments" that would not otherwise be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code absent such Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Potential 280G
Benefits_ "); (ii) to the extent it has not done so prior to the date hereof,
use its best efforts prior to seeking such Company Shareholder Approval, to
secure from each of the individuals who has a right to any Potential 280G
Benefits a waiver of such individuals rights to some or all of such
Potential 280G Benefits so that all remaining Potential 280G Benefits shall
not be deemed to be "parachute payments" that would not be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code; and (iii) deliver to Parent, prior to seeking such
Company Shareholder Approval, advance notice of such shareholder vote and
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that Company Shareholder Approval
of the Potential 280G Benefits will be solicited in accordance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1.

reasonable best efforts to obtain any financing necessary to pay the Merger
Consideration (the "Financing").

Section 4.15. _Non-Competition_.

  

(a) In connection with the sale of their interests in the Company, each of
Tom Sosnoff (" _Sosnoff_ ") and Scott Sheridan (" _Sheridan_ ") acknowledges
and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates and agrees that, for a period of
three years following the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), he will
not, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any
Person, directly or indirectly: (i) engage in any business that competes with
the businesses of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates (including,
without limitation, businesses which the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates have specific plans to conduct in the future and in connection
with which the Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates have expended more
than nominal time and/or capital and as to which plans he is aware) in any
geographical area in which the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates
produces, sells, leases, rents, licenses or otherwise provides its products
or services, including without limitation any retail and institutional
securities and brokerage business that has a niche market in or is focused on
offering services that facilitate the trading of exchange traded equity and
index options (an " _Options B-D_ "), the investor education business, and
the business of developing financial services software or technology for an
Options B-D or the investor education market (a " _Competitive Business_
"); (ii) enter the employ of, or render any services to, any Person (or
any division or controlled or controlling Affiliate of any Person) who or
which engages in a Competitive Business; (iii) acquire a financial interest
in, or otherwise become actively involved with, any Competitive Business,
directly or indirectly, as an individual, partner, shareholder, officer,
director, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or (iv) interfere with,
or attempt to interfere with, business relationships (whether formed before,
on or after the date of this Agreement) between the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Affiliates and customers, clients, contractors, managers,
consultants, suppliers or investors of the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.15(a),
each of Sosnoff and Sheridan may, directly or indirectly, own, solely as an
investment, securities of any Person engaged in the business of the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates which are publicly traded on a national or
regional stock exchange or on the over-the-counter market if he (i) is not a
controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and
(ii) does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of
securities of such Person.

  

(b) It is expressly understood and agreed that although each of Sosnoff,
Sheridan and Parent consider the restrictions contained in this Section 4.15
to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of
competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction
contained in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against either of
Sosnoff or Sheridan, the provisions of this Section 4.15 shall not be
rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time
and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Section
4.15 is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make
it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of
the other restrictions contained herein.

  

Section 4.16. _Related Agreements_.

  

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, on behalf of
Parent and pursuant to the request of Parent, to cause each Stockholder party
to the Voting Agreement to comply with the Voting Agreement.

  

(b) On or before the Closing Date, the Company and Parent will execute and
deliver, and will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Escrow Agent to execute and deliver, and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Stockholders Agent to execute
and deliver, the Escrow Agreement contemplated by Article VII, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ").

       

Section 4.17. _Stockholders  Agreement_. On or before the Closing Date,
Parent shall execute and deliver, and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the stockholders of the Company referred to
therein to execute and deliver, a Stockholders Agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the " _Stockholders  Agreement_").

  

Section 4.18. _Employment Agreements_. On or before the Closing
Date, Sosnoff and Sheridan shall each enter into an Employment Agreement
with Parent, conditioned on the Closing and effective as of the Closing Date,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and Exhibit C,
respectively (collectively, the " _Executive Employment Agreements_ ").

  

Section 4.19. _Reporting Issuer_. Parent shall take all
commercially reasonable steps and actions and do all such acts and things

Section 7.3. _ Indemnification._

  

(a) The Stockholders agree, severally, but not jointly, in accordance with
their relative receipt of the Merger Consideration, to indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) and
each of their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, successors
and assigns (hereinafter referred to

       

individually as a " _Parent Indemnified Person_ " and collectively as "
_Parent Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all amounts,

liabilities, costs and expenses, including interest, penalties and reasonable
legal fees, arising out of, resulting from or relating to any of
the following matters, including liabilities for Taxes (but excluding (i)

setoff therefor against the distribution to be made pursuant to Section

(v) in connection with the Dissenting Shares, _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Losses shall be limited to one half of the amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (A) any amounts Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation is required by a court of competent jurisdiction to pay, or pays
in settlement, in respect of any Dissenting Shares over (B) the amount of the
Merger Consideration into which such Dissenting Shares would have been
converted in the Merger had such shares not been Dissenting Shares.

  

The Escrow Fund shall be security (and not a cap) for the indemnity
obligations set forth above, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement. Any amounts that may become due and payable to any Parent
Indemnified Person under this Section 7.3(a) shall be satisfied, first, out

aggregate liability hereunder shall not exceed the amount of the Merger
Consideration and each Stockholders individual liability shall not exceed
the amount of the Merger Consideration received by such Stockholder. The only
legal action that may be asserted by a Parent Indemnified Person against the
Stockholders with respect to any matter that is the subject of this _Article

an indemnification claim for the breach of, this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no legal action based upon predecessor

Persons against any of the Stockholders with respect to any matter that is
the subject of this _Article VII._

  

(c) For indemnification under Section 7.3(a)(iv), claims must be made prior
to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, and the Stockholders
aggregate liability thereunder shall not exceed $500,000. A claim for
indemnification under any other subsection of Section 7.3(a) must be made at

Stockholder, to the actual cash portion of the Merger Consideration received
by such Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the Stockholders liability in regard to a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article VII shall be borne _pro rata_ by the Stockholders,
with each Stockholders liability in regards to any such claim being limited
to such Stockholders proportionate receipt of the Merger Consideration.

any Escrow Claim Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to such date.

  

(c) Amounts not distributed under paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall remain
in the Escrow Fund until the related claims have been resolved or until any
such portion of the remaining amount of the Escrow Fund is determined
pursuant to Section 7.5 to be no longer necessary to satisfy such claims (but
in no event later than two years after the last claim has been made). As soon
as all such claims have been resolved or any such portion of the remaining
amount of the Escrow Fund is determined pursuant to Section 7.5 to be no
longer necessary to satisfy such claims, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
the Stockholders Agent on behalf of the Stockholders the remaining portion
of the Escrow Fund, if any, not required to satisfy such claims.

  

(d) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before the date specified in
Section 7.4(b) of a notice from Parent (an " _Escrow Claim Notice_ ") stating
that an indemnification claim or claims pursuant to Section 7.3(a) is being
made (including in reasonable detail a summary of the circumstances from
which such claim or claims arises and a description of the alleged Losses),
the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5 below,
deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, cash
held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses.

  

Section 7.5. _ Objections to Claims; Resolution of Conflicts._

  

(a) At the time of delivery of any Escrow Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent,
a duplicate copy of such Escrow Claim Notice shall be delivered to
the Stockholders Agent, and, for a period of fifteen (15) Business Days
after such delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Escrow Claim Notice, the
Escrow Agent shall make no payment pursuant to Section 7.4(d) hereof unless
the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Stockholders Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such

       

fifteen (15) Business Day period, the Escrow Agent shall make payment in
accordance with Section 7.4(d) hereof; _provided_ that no such payment may
be made if and to the extent the Stockholders Agent shall object in a
written statement (describing the basis for any objection with reasonable
specificity) to the claim made in the Escrow Claim Notice and such statement
shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the
expiration of such fifteen (15) Business Day period.

  

(b) In case the Stockholders Agent shall so object in writing to any claim
or claims by Parent made in any Escrow Claim Notice, the Stockholders Agent
and Parent shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Stockholders Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and shall pay the amount set forth in such memorandum in
accordance with the terms thereof.

  

(c) If no such agreement can be reached after the aforementioned good faith
negotiation, Parent may institute proceedings in a court of competent
jurisdiction (in accordance with Section 8.11) to resolve any such dispute,
and each of Parent and Stockholders Agent shall seek to resolve such dispute
promptly in a commercially reasonable manner.

  

(d) For purposes of this Section 7.5(d), in any proceeding brought under
Section 7.5(c) in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Escrow
Claim Notice is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing
party, unless the court awards Parent one-half (1/2) or more of the amount in
dispute, in which case the Stockholders shall be deemed to be the non-
prevailing parties. The non-prevailing party or parties to any such
proceeding shall pay its or their own expenses and the expenses, including
without limitation attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred by the
other party to the proceeding (which, where the Stockholders Agent is the
non-prevailing party, shall be paid to Parent out of the Escrow Fund).

  

Section 7.6. _ Stockholders Agent._

  

(a) Sheridan shall be, and hereby is, constituted and appointed as agent
and attorney-in-fact (" _Stockholders  Agent_") for and on behalf of the
Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
payment to Parent from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent,
to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to receive
distributions from the Escrow Fund on behalf of the Stockholders, and to take
all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders
Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing, all on behalf of and with
binding effect on, each of the Stockholders. Such agency may be changed by
the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund from time to time
upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent. No bond
shall be required of the Stockholders Agent, and the Stockholders Agent
shall receive no compensation for services rendered. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholders Agent shall constitute notice to
or from each of the Stockholders.

  

(b) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Stockholders Agent while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Stockholders shall severally, but not jointly, indemnify the Stockholders
Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or reasonable expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of the duties hereunder with such apportionment calculated
in accordance with the portion of the Merger Consideration received by each
such Stockholder.

   

46   

  

(c) The Stockholders Agent shall have reasonable access to information about
the Company and the reasonable assistance of the Companys officers and
employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
hereunder; _provided_ that the Stockholders Agent shall treat confidentially
and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to
anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
information confidentially).

  

Section 7.7. _ Actions of the Stockholders Agent._ A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders Agent shall constitute a
decision of all Stockholders for whom funds are deposited in the Escrow Fund
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Stockholder, and
the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each and every such Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent
are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by
them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the Stockholders Agent shall have no authority to enter into any
settlement agreement or other instrument that includes any admission of guilt
or wrongdoing by any Stockholder without the prior written consent of such
Stockholder.

  

Section 7.8. _ Notice; Third-Party Claims._

  

(a) Promptly after receipt (and in any event within 20 days) by a Parent
Indemnified Person under Section 7.3 of notice of the commencement of any
third party claim which such Parent Indemnified Person reasonably believes
may result in a demand for indemnification against it, such Parent
Indemnified Person will, if a claim is to be made against the Stockholders
for indemnification hereunder, give notice to the Stockholders and the
Stockholders Agent of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to
notify the Stockholders and the Stockholders Agent will not relieve the
Stockholders of any liability that they may have to any Parent Indemnified
Person, except to the extent that the Stockholders demonstrate that the
defense of such action is prejudiced by the Parent Indemnified Person s
failure to give such notice.

  

(b) If any third-party claim referred to in Section 7.8(a) is brought against
a Parent Indemnified Person and it gives notice to the Stockholders and
the Stockholders Agent of the commencement of such third-party claim,
the Stockholders will, unless the claim involves Taxes, be entitled to
participate in such Action and, to the extent that they wish (unless the
Stockholders are also a party to such Action and the Parent Indemnified
Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate due to a bona fide conflict of interest), to assume the defense
of such Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Indemnified
Person and, after notice from the Stockholders to the Parent Indemnified
Person of their election to assume the defense of such Action, the
Stockholders will not, as long as they reasonably diligently conduct such
defense, be liable to the Parent Indemnified Person under this Section 7.8
for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Action, in each case subsequently incurred by the Parent
Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Action, other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If it is determined that joint
representation is inappropriate due to a bona fide conflict of interest, then
the Stockholders shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of one separate
counsel for the Parent Indemnified Person. If the Stockholders assume the
defense of an Action, (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes of
this Agreement that such claims are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be
effected by the Stockholders without the Parent Indemnified Person s consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld) unless (A) there is no finding or admission
of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no
effect on any other claims that may be made against the Parent Indemnified
Person, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Stockholders; and (iii) the Parent Indemnified Person will have
no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
effected without its consent. If notice is given to the Stockholders and the
Stockholders Agent of any third party Action and the Stockholders do not,
within ten days after the Parent Indemnified Persons notice is given, give
notice to the Parent Indemnified Person of their

       

election to assume the defense of such Action, the Stockholders will be bound
by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Parent Indemnified Person.

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Parent Indemnified Person determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that an Action may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the Parent Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Stockholders
and the Stockholders Agent, assume the exclusive right to defend,
compromise, or settle such Action, but the Stockholders will not be bound by
any determination of a claim so defended or any compromise or settlement
effected without their consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

  

Section ******7.9. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_**. The parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, unless
otherwise required by applicable law. Any amounts payable pursuant to this
Article VII shall be (a) reduced by any proceeds received from insurance
policies, risk sharing pools, or similar arrangements covering the Losses
that are the subject to the claim for indemnity, (b) reduced by any proceeds
received from third parties, through indemnification, counterclaim or
otherwise in compensation for the subject matter of an indemnification claim
by such Parent Indemnified Person and (c) adjusted appropriately to take into
account any Tax benefits resulting from the Losses that are the subject of
the indemnity and receipt of the indemnification payment. If any proceeds,
benefits or recoveries are received by a Parent Indemnified Person with
respect to any Losses after a Parent Indemnified Person has received an
indemnification payment pursuant to this Article VII with respect thereto,
and receipt of such proceeds, benefits or recoveries prior to such
indemnification payment would have reduced the amount of such indemnification
payment if received prior to such payment pursuant to this Section 7.9, then
such Parent Indemnified Person shall promptly, but in any event no later than
ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such proceeds, benefits or
recoveries, proportionately pay the amount of such proceeds, benefits
or recoveries to the Stockholders with such apportionment calculated in
accordance with the portion of the Merger Consideration received by each such
Stockholder.

  

 **ARTICLE VIII 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

Section 8.1. _ Tax Matters._

  

(a) The Company shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company that are required to be
filed on or prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with past practice and in accordance with Law. The
Company shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the relevant Governmental
Authority all Taxes due in connection with any such Tax Returns. Parent shall
timely prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all other Tax
Returns in respect of the Company.

  

(b) Parent agrees that, at the request of the Stockholders Agent, it shall
file amended federal income tax returns to carry back to the fullest extent
possible any net operating losses shown on the federal income Tax Return for
the taxable period ending on the Closing Date to the two preceding tax years
for the benefit of the Stockholders. Any net operating loss carryforward (as
adjusted for carrybacks) resulting from such period will be for the benefit
of Parent. Any refunds of Taxes attributable to net operating loss carrybacks
pursuant to this paragraph shall be placed in the Escrow Fund on or promptly
after the date of receipt of the refund from the Internal Revenue Service,
and such amounts shall be released to the Stockholders upon the date
specified in Section 7.4(b). Any amounts payable to the Stockholders pursuant
to this paragraph shall first be applied against any outstanding
indemnity obligation of the Stockholders under Section 7.3(a)(ii). Parent
agrees that any Tax deductions relating to the payment of the Option

       

Consideration shall be reported on the Companys federal income Tax Return
for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date.

  

(c) Except as described in Section 8.1(b), any refunds or credits of Taxes of
the Company shall be for the account of Parent.

  

(d) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority that, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment to any Parent Indemnified Person
pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(ii) or (iv) hereof, the Parent Indemnified Person
shall notify the Stockholders promptly of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ").
Parent shall control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim,
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the results of any such contest could
reasonably be expected to result in material adverse Tax consequences to the
Stockholders, the Stockholders at their own expense, shall have a right to
participate in the defense and settlement of any such Tax Claim. Each
Stockholder shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Parent and the Surviving Corporation in contesting any
Tax Claim under this Section 8.1(d). There shall be no settlement or
closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of
the Stockholders, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

(e) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Company and the
Stockholders Agent will provide each other with such cooperation
and information as any of them reasonably may request of the other in filing
any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund or
indemnification, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of
Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing
copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules and related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities. Each party shall make
its employees available at no cost to the other on a mutually convenient
basis to provide explanations of any documents or information provided
hereunder. Each party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers
and for material records or other documents relating to Tax matters of the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for its taxable period first ending
after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of
(i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such returns and other documents relate, including extensions for the
respective Tax periods, or (ii) eight years following the due date (including
extensions) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this Section
8.1(e) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of returns or claims for refund or in conducting
an audit or other proceeding.

  

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration
and any other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer
Taxes) and related fees (including any penalties, interest and additions to
Tax) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising out of or incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be borne by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
"Transfer Taxes" do not include income, withholding or employment Taxes. The
party that is legally required to file a Tax Return relating to Transfer
Taxes shall be responsible for preparing and timely filing such Tax Return.

shall be to a Section, subsection, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The word "herein" and similar references
mean, except where a specific Section or Article reference is expressly
indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any specific Section or Article.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the word "material," when
used in reference to any partys representations, warranties or covenants,
shall mean material in relation to such party. The table of contents and the
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 8.6. _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of

       

the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

  

Section 8.7. _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the
Related Agreements (including all exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto)
and other documents and instruments delivered in connection herewith
constitute the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings (other than the Confidentiality Agreement), both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

  

Section 8.8. _ Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign
all or any of their rights hereunder to any Affiliate; _provided_ that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

  

Section 8.9. _ Parties in Interest._ This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and each

express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person,

extent set forth in Article VII, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

Section 8.10. _ Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative._
No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

  

Section 8.11. _ Governing Law; Enforcement._ This Agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Law of the State of Delaware. The parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any Related Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Related Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any
Related Agreement in the Delaware state or federal court sitting in the state
of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto, (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware state
or federal court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
Related Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any Related Agreement

Related Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

 _Section 8.12._ _ Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in
