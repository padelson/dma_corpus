tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of
$30.25 (such amount or, if the Offer is amended in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and a different amount per share is paid pursuant to the
Offer, such different amount, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in
cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Section
251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation, and pursuant to the Merger, each
share of Company Common Stock that is not validly tendered and irrevocably
accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer, except as provided in this
Agreement, shall be converted in the Merger into the right to receive
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, net to the seller in cash and
without interest;

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, effected as soon as practicable
following the consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the
Offer;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that the

performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions, (iii) declared this Agreement and the

declared this Agreement advisable;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Sub entering into this
Agreement, certain  holders of the Company Common Stock (the " _Principal Stockholders_ ") have
entered into tender and voting agreements, dated as of the date hereof, in
substantially the form set forth in Annex I, pursuant to which, among other
things, each of the Principal Stockholders has agreed to tender his, her or
its shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer (the " _Tender Agreements_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

The Offer

 

SECTION 1.01 _The Offer_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten
business days after the date of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
")) the Offer at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit_ _ _
_A_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The initial expiration date of the Offer
shall be at the time that is one minute following 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on the date that is twenty business days (determined using Rule
14d-1(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "))
after the date the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right
to waive any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer, except that,
without the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall
not permit Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive, amend or
modify the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination Condition, (iv) add to
the Offer Conditions or impose any other conditions on the Offer or amend,
modify or supplement any Offer Condition in any manner adverse to the holders
of Company Common Stock in their capacity as such, (v) change the form or
terms of consideration payable in the Offer, or (vi) otherwise amend, modify
or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock in their capacity as such. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (A)
extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten
business days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by the
Company), if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not have been
satisfied or waived, until such time as such conditions shall have been
satisfied or waived (irrespective of whether the Minimum Tender Condition has
been satisfied) and (B) extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
any rule, regulation or interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff
thereof or the NASDAQ Capital Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") applicable to the Offer;
provided that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date. In addition, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of
the Offer each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition)
shall have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender Condition shall
not have been satisfied, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, extend the Offer at the request of the Company for one or more consecutive
increments of not more than ten business days each (or for such longer period
as may be agreed by the Company); provided that

 



2  Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if, as of the scheduled
expiration date, all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived, but
there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary to permit the
Merger to be effected without a meeting of the Companys stockholders, Merger
Sub may provide a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable
after the expiration of the Offer and, in any event, no more than two
business days after the Offer Closing Date. The date on which Merger Sub first
accepts for payment the shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer
is referred to as the " _Offer Closing Date_ ". The Offer may not be
terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this _Section 1.01(a)_ ), unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_. If
the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ , Merger Sub shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to
return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders
thereof. Nothing contained in this _Section 1.01(a)_ shall affect any
termination rights set forth in _Section 8.01_.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include or incorporate by
reference an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and  _Exhibit_
___A_ (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which
the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto,
the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) disseminate the Offer Documents to the
holders of Company Common Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent
and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange
Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer
Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to
be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. Federal
securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall reasonably inform the
Company and its counsel of any oral comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing of
the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with
the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock,
or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (x) provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or
response (including the proposed final version thereof), and (y) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company or
its counsel.

 



3 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(d) Parent, the Company and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer, such
amounts as Parent, the Company or Merger Sub is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or
withholding was made.

(e) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring or
having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Offer Closing Date, in each case, effected in compliance with _Section 5.01_
, and the Offer Price as so adjusted shall provide to the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such action.

 

SECTION 1.02 _Company Actions_. (a) Subject to _Sections_ _ _ _5.03_ and
_8.04_ , the Company hereby approves the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Transactions_ ").

(b) Subject to _Section 5.03_ , on the date the Offer Documents are filed
with the SEC or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company shall file
with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any exhibits,
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule_ ___14D-9_ "), including a
description of the Company Board Recommendation (subject to _Section 5.03_ )
and include a notice of appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
Federal securities Laws and Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent and Merger Sub
shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
U.S. Federal securities Laws and Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform Parent and its counsel of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing of the
Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or
the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or
responding to any

 



4  comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall
(x) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final
version thereof), and (y) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board
Recommendation (subject to the prior sentence and except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified the Company Board
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.03(b)_ ).

 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date
and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together
with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer
files and all other information in the Companys possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to
Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer and the Merger. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the
Company (and shall cause their agents to deliver to the Company) all copies of
such information.

Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State or at such other time as

SECTION 2.04 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. The Merger shall be
governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, without a vote of
the stockholders of the Company. The parties agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as

the Surviving Corporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company, as amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form attached as

permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.04_ , the By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or

SECTION 2.07 _Directors and Officers_. (a) The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their

SECTION 2.08 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



6 (b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of other Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections _2.08(b)_ ,
and _2.08(d)_ , each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash and
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.09_ , without interest.

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section_ _ _ _262_ ") shall not be converted into the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.08(c)_ , but instead the
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market
value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; provided that
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.08(c)_. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in, and after the Offer Closing Date, direct all
negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

SECTION 2.09 _Payment of Merger Consideration_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration to former holders of Company Common
Stock. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with
the Paying Agent, immediately after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay
for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
cash pursuant to _Section 2.08(c)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Payment Fund_ ").

 



7 (b) _Payment Procedure_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") which were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.08_ (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.08_ , and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.09_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.08_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

(c) _Treatment of Book-Entry Shares_. No holder of record of Book-Entry Shares
shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such holder of record shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or
such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time to each such holder of record as of the Effective Time), an
amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration
to which such holder is entitled hereunder, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
forthwith be canceled.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ as a
result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

 



8 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Merger Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent or its designated affiliate, upon demand,
and any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or its successor-in-interest for payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Law).

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such date become the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designated affiliate, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representative
previously entitled thereto, subject to the claims of any former holder of
Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_.

 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest. Nothing contained in this _Section 2.09(h)_ and
no investment losses resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund shall
diminish the rights of the stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration.
To the extent there are losses or the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason
below the level required to promptly pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.08(c)_ , Parent shall replace or restore the cash in the Payment
Fund to ensure the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of,
and paid to, Parent or its designated affiliate.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise

 



9  payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

 

SECTION 2.10 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and converted into
the right to receive, (i) an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the
excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the " _Company Stock
Option Cash Consideration_ "). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay the Company Stock Option Cash Consideration at or reasonably promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the later of (x) five
business days after the Effective Time or (y) the first payroll date following
the Effective Time), subject to applicable tax withholding.

(b) The Company shall not commence any purchase period under the Company ESPP
after the date hereof and, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Company ESPP to terminate.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, providing
for the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.10_. The Company shall
provide that, following the Effective Time, no holder of any Company Stock
Option or participant in the Company ESPP shall have the right to acquire any
equity interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in respect
thereof. 

SECTION 2.11 _Treatment of Warrants_. Company Warrants shall be treated in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Warrant Agreement. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall deliver notice of the
Transactions to the holders of Company Warrants in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Warrant Agreement. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume each Company Warrant that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and not terminated pursuant to its terms without any
action on the part of the holder thereof.

10  this Agreement, from the Company to Parent and Merger Sub (which shall be

warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

SECTION 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly

under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of
good standing, to the extent the concept is recognized by such jurisdiction),
except (other than with respect to the Companys due organization and valid
existence) where any such failure would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (a) has full power and authority
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and (b) is duly
qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business or its ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure to have
such power and authority or to be so qualified or licensed would not

Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as

convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based incentive units or other
rights to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company or other rights that
give the holder thereof any economic interest of a nature accruing to the
holders of Company Common Stock, other than the issuance of Company Common
Stock upon the exercise of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants.

 



11 (b) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all such shares

partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any
Person.

relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights and remedies, or
by general principles of equity governing the availability of equitable
remedies, whether considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity and except as
rights to indemnity and contribution may be limited by state or Federal
securities laws or public policy underlying such laws (the " _Bankruptcy,
Equity and Indemnity Exception_ ")).

SECTION 3.05 _No Conflicts; Consents_. (a) The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien other than any

Company Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Company Charter, the
Company By-laws or the comparable organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary, (ii) any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary

that for purposes of this _Section 3.05(a)_ , clause (G) of the definition of
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect", shall not be excluded in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would

or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed
that for purposes of this _Section 3.05(b)_ , clause (G) of the definition of
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect", shall not be excluded in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would
reasonably be expected to occur).

into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement providing for any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) if
the Company Board receives a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ in accordance with
_Section 8.04(b)_ ; provided that, prior to so making an Intervening Event
Adverse Recommendation Change or so terminating this Agreement, (1) the
Company Board shall have given Parent at least four calendar days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the
reasons for taking such action (which notice, in respect of a Superior
Company Proposal, shall specify the identity of the Person who made such
Superior Company Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Company Proposal and attach the most current version of the relevant
transaction agreement), (2) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused its Representatives to negotiate in good faith, with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would eliminate the
need for taking such action (and in respect of a Superior Company Proposal,
would cause such Superior Company Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Company Proposal), (3) following the end of such notice period, the Company
Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement
offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if
accepted by the Company, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to effect such

 



36  Company Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement to accept a Superior Company Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, with respect to a Superior Company
Proposal, that such Superior Company Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Company Proposal and (4) in the event of any change to any of the
financial or other material terms (including the form, amount and timing of
payment of consideration) of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with
that described in clause (1) of this proviso and a renewed notice
period under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four-
calendar-day notice period referred to in clause (1) of this proviso shall
instead be equal to three calendar days) during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.03(b)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) of
this proviso.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), including making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company,
or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take any such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that this _Section 5.03(c)_
shall not be deemed to affect whether any such action (other than a
recommendation against a Company Takeover Proposal or a "stop-look-and-listen"
communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) would otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(d) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
this _Section 5.03_ , the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in
any event within one business day after receipt thereof, advise Parent orally
and in writing of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for
information or inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company reasonably
believes could lead to or contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii)
the terms and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry,
proposal or offer (including any subsequent amendments or modifications
thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer. Commencing upon the provision of any
notice referred to above, the Company and its Representatives shall keep
Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis as to the status and details of
any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (and any
subsequent amendments or modifications thereto). The Company agrees that in
the event any Company Subsidiary, or any Representative of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, takes any action which, if taken by the Company would
constitute a breach of this _Section 5.03_ , the Company shall be deemed to be
in breach of this _Section 5.03_.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary confidentiality

power of the capital stock of the Company or (ii) any tender offer, exchange

parent of the Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the

knowledge of the Company Board, was not reasonably foreseeable as of the date

that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published forecasts or
projections for any period, or any changes after the date of this Agreement
in the market price or trading volume of Company Common Stock, (y) the

and other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal and of this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and

Additional Agreements

SECTION 6.01 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Except if prohibited
by any applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents Representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours (under the supervision of appropriate
personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) during
the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
to all their respective properties, books and records, Contracts and personnel
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to, furnish, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request; provided that any such access shall be afforded and any
such information shall be furnished at Parents expense. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be required to afford access or furnish information to the
extent (and after notice to Parent) (a) such information is subject to the
terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (b) such information
relates to the applicable portions of the minutes of the meetings of the
Company Board (including any presentations or other materials prepared by or
for the Company Board) where the Company Board discussed the Transactions or
any similar transaction involving the sale of the Company to, or combination
of the Company with, any other Person, or (c) the Company determines in good
faith that affording such access or furnishing such information would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or violate applicable Law or result in significant antitrust
risk for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable;
provided that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
required consents for the disclosure of such information and take such other
reasonable action (including entering into a joint defense agreement or
similar arrangement to avoid loss of attorney-client privilege) with respect
to such information as is necessary to permit disclosure to Parent. All
information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall be subject to
the confidentiality letter agreement dated December 22, 2014 between the
Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

SECTION 6.02 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties

Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers and consents from,
the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and
the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid a Proceeding
by any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions
and (ii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and the Company Board shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no
Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement and (B) if any Takeover Law or similar statute
or regulation becomes

 



39  applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary
to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the
other, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ")
and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification
and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in
no event later than ten business days after the date of this Agreement). Any
such filings shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the
HSR Act or the applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, as the case may be. Each of
Parent and the Company shall (i) subject to applicable Law, furnish to the
other party as promptly as reasonably practicable such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR
Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, (ii) give the other party reasonable prior
notice of any such filings or submissions and promptly notify the other party

additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other party (and its

views of, and secure the participation of, the other party in connection
with, any such proposed filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or
requests, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not
participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions without the other party, (B) give the other
party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the
event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting or
engaging in any such conversation, keep such party apprised with respect
thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white
papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E)
subject to applicable Law, furnish the other party with copies of all filings,
submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
any Governmental Entitys staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and (iv) respond
to any inquiry or request from the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Entity as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties agree not to
extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act or any
Foreign Antitrust Law or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity
to delay or not to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other party
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

SECTION 6.03 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Offer Closing Date
and for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to individuals who are

 



40  employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") (i)
for each Company Employee, salary and incentive opportunities (excluding
equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to such Company Employee by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Offer Closing Date and (ii) for Company
Employees in the aggregate, employee benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employee by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Offer Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Continuation Period,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide any
Company Employee who experiences a termination of employment under
circumstances that would have entitled such Company Employee to severance
benefits under either the severance plan or policy of the Company or its
affiliates applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Offer
Closing Date or a severance plan or policy of Parent or its affiliates
applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent and its affiliates at the
time of such termination, with severance benefits at a level at least equal
to the greater of those that would have been provided under any such severance
plan or policy, in each case, except to the extent it would result in any
duplication of benefits.

 

(b) Following the Continuation Period, the Company Employees shall be entitled
to participate in the plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective affiliates (the " _Surviving Corporation Plans_ ") to the same
extent as other similarly situated employees of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective affiliates. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, following the Effective
Time, each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Surviving Corporation Plans to the
extent coverage under any such plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan (and to the same extent as participation was provided
under such Company Benefit Plan) in which such Company Employee participates
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.03(a)_ , from and after the
Offer Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or, if later, until
all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Companys
employment, severance, retention, termination and change in control plans,
policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in
control severance agreement or other Company Benefit Agreement between the
Company and any Company Employee) maintained by the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect at the Offer Closing Date, including
with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event) in
accordance with their terms.

 

(d) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or
any of its respective subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and
severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and
early retirement subsidies, each Company Employees service with the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer
of the Company or any

 



41  such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer
was recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries (to the same
extent as such service was recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit
Plan and Company Benefit Agreement); provided that such service need not be
recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service or (ii) with respect to
any benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan.

 

(e) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions and
waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and
their eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations
were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible
dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit
Plan in which such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) provide Company Employees and their eligible dependents and
beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
maximum requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan, in each
case, except to the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or any other Person
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent provided in _Section 9.07_
with respect to _Section 6.04_ ), and no provision of this  _Section 6.03_
shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that
may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement or any employee program or any plan or
arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall, nor shall be
construed to, modify, amend, or establish any benefit plan, program or
arrangement or in any way affect the ability of the parties hereto or any
other Person to modify, amend or terminate any of its benefit plans, programs
or arrangements or terminate the employment or service of any Company
Employee.

(g) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five days prior
to the Effective Time, contingent upon the Merger Closing, the Company shall
take all necessary actions to terminate any Company Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_ "), with such termination effective as of the date immediately
preceding the Merger Closing Date.

 

SECTION 6.04 _Indemnification_. (a) All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer,
employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee
benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the
Company Charter, the Company By-laws, the

 



42  organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement and that has
been made available to Parent (i) shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, (ii)
shall survive the Merger, (iii) shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any such
Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iv) for a period
of six years following the date of this Agreement, shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure that the
Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.04(a)_ or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the acceptance for
payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on,
or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer (including as a fiduciary
with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement
or any of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly
and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to
each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon
receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Proceeding. None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Proceeding for which indemnification could reasonably be sought by
an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any
matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder.
Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this _Section
6.04(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for the period beginning upon
the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and ending six years from the
Effective Time; provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Proceeding asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Proceeding.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully pay
the premium for "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policies
in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions) for the period
beginning upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for,
any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and ending six years
from the 

 



43  Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party and containing terms
(including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including
with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the
aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO Policies_"); provided that
the maximum aggregate annual premium for such "tail" insurance policies shall
not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for
covered for its current fiscal year under the Existing DandO Policies. If such
"tail" insurance policies have been obtained by the Company, Parent shall
cause such "tail" insurance policies to be maintained in full force and
effect, for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by it and the Surviving Corporation. In the event the Company does not
obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, for the period beginning upon the
acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and ending six years from the
Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Existing DandO Policies in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions); provided
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the
annual premium payable by the Company for coverage for its current fiscal year
under the Existing DandO Policies (which amount the Company represents and
warrants is set forth in _Section 6.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter);
_provided further_ that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain the most advantageous policies available for an annual premium equal
to such amount; and _provided further_ that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing
terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions
(including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually
and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party.

 

(d) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and
in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.04_.

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.04_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.04_ applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this
_Section 6.04_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to which each Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
Law, Contract or otherwise.

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.04_.

 



44 SECTION 6.05 _Fees and Expenses_ . (a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.01_
,  _Section 6.04_ , this _Section 6.05_ and _Section 6.07_ , all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $45,800,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ ") if:

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ ;

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ ; or

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is
publicly proposed or announced or made known to the Company Board and such
Company Takeover Proposal is not withdrawn prior to the final expiration date
of the Offer, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_  or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)_ and (C) within twelve months after such termination the
Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, a
Company Takeover Proposal.

 

For purposes of this _Section 6.05(b)_ , the term " _Company Takeover
Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal contained in _Section 5.03(e)_ except that all references to
20% shall be deemed references to 50%. Any fee due under this _Section
6.05(b)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an
account designated by Parent, (1) in the case of clause (i) above, prior to
or simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of
clause (ii) above, within two business days after the date of such termination
of this Agreement and (3) in the case of clause (iii) above, within two
business days of the consummation of such Company Takeover Proposal. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 

(c) Acceptance by Parent of the fee due under _Section 6.05(b)(i)_ shall
constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of this
Agreement under _Section 8.01(g)_. In the event the Company Termination Fee
described in this _Section 6.05_ is paid to Parent, such Company Termination
Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective current,
former or future Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of the
Company Termination Fee, none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective current, former or future Representatives shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. 

SECTION 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and provide

 



45  each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national or foreign securities exchange and except
as permitted or required by _Section 5.03_. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be
in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

SECTION 6.07 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided in _Section 2.09(b)_ of this
Agreement, all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp,
recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions
to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the
Transactions shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation, and the Company
shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing
any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

SECTION 6.08 _Stockholder Litigation_. Until the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company shall provide Parent an
opportunity to review and to propose comments to all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any stockholder

Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) except for _Section 6.04_ , are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or
remedies. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence,
following the Effective Time the provisions of _Article II_ shall be
enforceable by holders of Certificates and holders of Book-Entry Shares, the
provisions of _Section_ _ _ _2.10_ shall be enforceable by holders of awards

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ ,
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any
Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to

the

 



56  due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent
and Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company
certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plans and cost-related plan
information, regarding the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, with which
Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are making
their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans and cost-related plans, furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans),
and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any
other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any representation or warranty or has or shall
have any liability (whether pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise)
with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans),
except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement.

 

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ ,
the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with
respect to any other information made available to the Company in connection
with the Transactions.

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

 

SECTION 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; provided that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger
Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided further_ that
any such assignment shall not take place after the commencement of the Offer
and shall not otherwise materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of
the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns. 

 



57 SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties acknowledge
and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section 9.10(b)_ ,
without proof of damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The right to seek specific enforcement shall include the
right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties further agree not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Transactions and without such right, none of the parties would
have entered into this Agreement. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party
brings any Proceeding, in each case in accordance with _Section 9.10(b)_ , to
seek to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
(i) the amount of time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus 20
business days or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Proceeding, as the case may be.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware, for the purpose
of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such Proceeding may be
heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or Federal court. Each
of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State
of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the
event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by U.S.
registered mail to such partys respective address set forth in _Section
9.02_ (provided that nothing in this _Section 9.10(b)_ shall affect the right
of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law) and
(iv) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than
the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties hereto agree that a final trial
court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law; provided that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any
partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from,
such final trial court judgment.

 



58 SECTION 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or any other Transaction. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section
9.11_.

SECTION 9.12  _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
rights and remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

SECTION 9.13 _Cooperation_. The parties agree to provide reasonable
cooperation with each other and to execute and deliver such further documents,
certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such actions as may be
reasonably requested by the other parties to evidence or effect the
Transactions and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

60 Exhibit A

 

to

Agreement and Plan of Merger

Offer Conditions

 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) if (a) there shall not have been
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the
Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding shares tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received",
as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL) that, when added to the shares
of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent or Merger Sub, would represent
one share more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, including any shares of Company Common Stock issuable to holders of
Company Warrants that are deemed exercised in accordance with their terms
immediately prior to such time (such condition in this clause (a), the "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (b) any waiting period under the HSR Act
applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the consummation of the Merger shall have neither expired nor been
terminated.

 

Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to
cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for
any shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or
paid for if, at the expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions
exists: 

(i) there shall be any Legal Restraint in effect preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger; provided that the party seeking to
assert this condition shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations of _Section_ _ _ _6.02_ in respect of any such Legal Restraint;

 

(ii) (A) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Article
III_ (other than those set forth in  _Sections_ _ _ _3.02(a)-_ _(d)_ , _3.04_
, _3.08(a)_ and _3.20_ ) shall not be true and correct at such time, except to
the extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified
date (in which case on and as of such specified date), other than for such
failures to be true and correct that would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (for
purposes of determining the satisfaction of this condition, without regard to
any qualifications or exceptions contained therein as to " _materiality_ " or
" _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "), (B) any representation and warranty of
the Company set forth in _Sections_ _ _ _3.02(a)-(d)_ or _3.20_ shall not be
true and correct in all respects at such time, except where the failure to be
true and correct in all respects would not reasonably be expected to result
in additional cost, expense or liability to the Company, Parent and/or

 



A-1  their Affiliates, individually or in the aggregate with all other such
representations and warranties that is more than $10,000,000, (C) any
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section 3.04_ shall
not be true and correct in all material respects at such time, except to the
extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date
(in which case on and as of such specified date), and (D) any representation
and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section 3.08(a)_ shall not be true
and correct in all respects at such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in which
case on and as of such specified date);

(iii) the Company shall have failed to comply with or perform in all material
respects all of the Companys covenants, agreements and obligations to be
performed by it as of such time under this Agreement;

 

(iv) Parent shall not have received a certificate executed by the Companys
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer confirming on behalf of
the Company that the conditions set forth in clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)" of
this Exhibit A have been duly satisfied; or

 

(v) this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with its
terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, may be waived by
Parent and Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the
Termination Condition). The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
