Preparation of Net Working Capital Statement. 

| 
---|---

Within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing Date (or such other date

writing), the Purchaser will prepare and deliver to the Vendor Representative
a draft unaudited statement of Net Working Capital (the "Draft Net Working
Capital Statement") of the Purchased Corporations prepared as of 11:59 p.m.
Pacific Time on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Draft Net
Working Capital Statement will be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on
a basis consistent with the preparation of the Current Balance Sheet and
consistent with the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

The Vendor Representative will have 20 Business Days to review the Draft Net
Working Capital Statement following receipt of it and the Vendor
Representative must notify the Purchaser in writing if it has any objections
to the Draft Net Working Capital Statement within such 20 Business Day period.
The notice of objection must contain a statement of the basis of each of the
Vendor Representative's objections and each amount in dispute. The Purchaser
shall provide access, upon every reasonable request, to the Vendor
Representative and its auditors, to all work papers of the Purchaser and its
auditors, accounting books and records and the appropriate personnel to verify
the accuracy, presentation and other matters relating to the preparation of
the Draft Net Working Capital Statement. If such access is unreasonably
delayed by the Purchaser or its auditor, then such 20 Business Day period
shall be extended for an additional 10 Business Days after such access has
been provided. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

If the Vendor Representative sends a notice of objection of the Draft Net
Working Capital Statement in accordance with Section 2.7(2), the Purchaser and
the Vendor Representative will work expeditiously and in good faith in an
attempt to resolve such objections within 20 Business Days following receipt
of the notice. Failing resolution of any objection to the Draft Net Working
Capital Statement raised by the Vendor Representative, the dispute will be
submitted for determination to the Independent Accountants. The determination
of the Independent Accountants will be final and binding upon the Parties and
will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error. The Independent
Accountants are deemed to be acting as experts and not as arbitrators. 
| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

If the Vendor Representative does not notify the Purchaser of any objection
within the 20 Business Day period, the Vendors are deemed to have accepted and
approved the Draft Net Working Capital Statement and the Draft Net Working
Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties, and
will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error. The Draft Net Working
Capital Statement will become the "Closing Net Working Capital Statement" on
the next Business Day following the end of such 20 Business Day period. 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

If the Vendor Representative sends a notice of objection in accordance with
Section 2.7(2), the Purchaser and the Vendor Representative will revise the
Draft Net Working Capital Statement to reflect the final resolution or final
determination of such objections under Section 2.7(3) within two (2) Business
Days following such final resolution or determination. Such revised Draft Net
Working Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Parties, and will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error. The Draft
Net Working Capital Statement will become the "Closing Net Working Capital
Statement" on the next Business Day following revision of the Draft Net
Working Capital Statement under this Section 2.7(5). 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

The Vendors and the Purchaser will each bear their own fees and expenses,
including the fees and expenses of their respective auditors, in preparing or
reviewing, as the case may be, the Draft Net Working Capital Statement. In the
case of a dispute and the retention of the Independent Accountants to
determine such dispute, the costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants
shall be allocated between the Vendors, as a group, and the Purchaser in the
same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to
the Independent Accountants that is unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as
finally determined by the Independent Accountants) bears to the total amount
of such disputed items so submitted by such Party. However, the Vendors and
the Purchaser will each bear their own costs in presenting their respective
cases to the Independent Accountants. 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this Section 2.7 for
resolving disputes with respect to the Draft Net Working Capital Statement is
the sole and exclusive method of resolving such disputes, absent manifest

shall deliver to Purchaser the Closing LTIP Payment Amount Statement.

to receive under Section 3.7(a)(ii) and Section 3.7(b) of the LTIP Agreements
less the LTIP Holdback Amount as set forth on the Closing LTIP Payment Amount
Statement and Purchaser shall cause Golden Boy to pay such reduction to the

accruals have been made in the Current Balance Sheets for any contributions

plan and applicable Laws, or else appropriate accruals have been made in the
Current Balance Sheets for any insurance premiums owing.

contract, arrangement or Employee Plan that has resulted or would result in a
payment that would not be fully deductible as a result of Section 280G of the
Code (determined without regard to the reasonableness of any such
compensation), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will give rise
to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Code
Section 280G. Except as specifically set forth on Section 3.1(hh) of the
Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or together with any other event: (i) entitle
any current or former director, independent contractor or employee of any
Purchased Corporation to severance pay, bonus amounts, retirement benefits,
unemployment compensation, termination benefits, or any other payment; or (ii)
trigger or accelerate the time of payment, funding, or vesting, or increase
the amount or value of any benefit or compensation due to any current or
former director, independent contractor or employee of any Purchased
Corporation. 
| 
---|--- 

(x)

|

Each Employee Plan that provides for the deferral of compensation subject to
Code Section 409A is, and has been, properly documented and operated in

alternative dispute resolution processes ("Legal Proceedings") in progress,
pending, or, to the knowledge of the Vendors, threatened against the Purchased
Corporations, the Business or any of the Purchased Corporations' Assets, which
if determined adversely to the Purchased Corporations would have a Material
Adverse Effect or which prohibits, restricts or seeks to enjoin the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 3.1(jj) of the Disclosure
Letter sets forth a description of all Legal Proceedings currently pending and
involving any Purchased Corporation, except to the extent that a reasonable
estimate of the aggregate value of the claims advanced in all such Legal
Proceedings that are omitted from the Disclosure Letter is less than $250,000.

of the Vendors or the Purchased Corporations that it is canceling or otherwise
terminating or materially altering, or that it intends to cancel or otherwise
terminate or materially alter, its relationship with the Purchased
Corporations, or that it intends to do so (and, for the purposes of this
Section 3.1(kk), an annualized change of less than $1,000,000 in the gross
annual sales to or purchases from any such supplier or customer will be deemed
immaterial), and, to the knowledge of the Vendors, there are no facts or
circumstances which would give grounds for such to occur.

Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Purchased Corporations)
under Treasury Regulation Section §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of

respect of the granting of a U.S. Quota for Calendar Year 2014. Golden Boy has
not received any notice from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and
Development Canada or any other Governmental Entity of any challenge to or

qualification to be allocated a U.S. Quota for 2014. No person, firm or
corporation has taken any action, or given notice to Golden Boy of any action,
with a view to causing the U.S. Quota for 2014 to be less than the U.S. Quota

Notice of Untrue Representation or Warranty. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Vendors if the Purchaser becomes aware
that any of the Purchaser's representations or warranties is untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or that the Purchaser has failed to perform
or fulfil any of its covenants or obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect during the Interim Period. Subject to Section 5.7(3), each
Vendor shall promptly notify the Purchaser if any of them becomes aware that
any of its representations or warranties is untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or that it has failed to perform or fulfil any of its
covenants or obligations under this Agreement in any material respect during
the Interim Period. 
| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Following notice by any of the Vendors or the Purchaser under Section 5.7(1)
solely in respect of any matter, fact or circumstance which first arose during
the Interim Period, the Vendors may, within five (5) Business Days after the

untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, revise the Disclosure Letter to
qualify the applicable representations and warranties and deliver such amended

conditions in Section 6.1 would not have been satisfied without the amendment
to the Disclosure Letter, the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by notice
in writing to the Vendors within five (5) Business Days of receiving the

commodities in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices,
but shall deliver a revised Disclosure Letter to the Purchaser no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to disclose any such
contract, commitment or arrangement; provided that no such revision to Section
3.1(aa)(xviii) of the Disclosure Letter will give the Purchaser the right to
terminate this Agreement under Section 5.7(2) or exercise any other remedy
under this Agreement. 

| 
---|---

|

Exclusivity. 

Until the earlier of the Closing Date and such time as this Agreement is

Purchaser when any such certificate, memorandum or short form of lease or non-
disturbance agreement has been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Vendors are under no obligation to pay any money, incur any obligation,
commence any legal proceeding, or offer or grant any accommodation (financial

secure any indebtedness of the Purchaser or its affiliates (provided such
pledging of collateral, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be effective
prior to the Closing); provided, however, that such actions do not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations or employee relations of the
Purchased Corporations; and, provided, further, that the Purchased
Corporations shall not be required to pay any commitment fee or other fee or

claims based upon the Vendor Fundamental Representations, the Vendor Major
Representations, the Vendor Tax Representations, Section 3.1(k) or based upon
willful breach or fraudulent misrepresentation, and (ii) the Cap shall not
apply to claims based upon the Vendor Fundamental Representations or the
Vendor Tax Representations or based upon willful breach or fraudulent
misrepresentation.

Section 9.5

|

Notification. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

If a Third Party Claim is instituted or asserted against an Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of the Third Party Claim. The notice must specify, in reasonable detail, the
identity of the Person making the Third Party Claim and, to the extent known,
the nature of the Damages. The failure of an Indemnified Party to promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced by such
failure. 
| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party
will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the Direct Claim.
The failure of an Indemnified Party to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the
Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

Notice to an Indemnifying Party under this Section 9.5 of a Direct Claim or a
Third Party Claim is assertion of a claim for indemnification against the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement. Upon receipt of such notice, the
provisions of Section 9.7 will apply to any Third Party Claim and the
provisions of Section 9.6 will apply to any Direct Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.6

|

Direct Claims. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Following receipt of notice of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party has
thirty (30) days to investigate the Direct Claim and respond in writing. For
purposes of the investigation, the Indemnified Party shall make available to
the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to
substantiate the Direct Claim, together with such other information as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

If the Indemnifying Party disputes the validity or amount of the Direct Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall provide written notice of the dispute to the
Indemnified Party within the thirty (30) day period specified in Section
9.6(1). The dispute notice must describe in reasonable detail the nature of
the Indemnifying Party's dispute. During the thirty (30) day period
immediately following receipt of a dispute notice by the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith
to resolve the dispute. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
fail to resolve the dispute within that thirty (30) day time period, the
Indemnified Party is free to pursue all rights and remedies available to it,
subject to this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party fails to respond in
writing to the Direct Claim within the sixty (60) day period specified in
Section 9.6(1), the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have rejected the Direct
Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party is free to pursue all rights
remedies available to it, subject to this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.7

|

Procedure for Third Party Claims. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Upon receiving notice of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may
participate in the investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim and may
also elect to assume the investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not assume the defence of a
Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is one
or more of the Vendors, a reasonable assessment of the likely amount of such
Third Party Claim is in excess of the Cap or (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks
an injunction or equitable relief against any Indemnified Party. To the extent
the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals therewith, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party
(which reasonable expenses shall be recoverable from time to time by
Indemnifying Party), and control the defense of such Third Party Claim. 
| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

In order to assume the investigation and defence of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Party written notice of its
election within thirty (30) days of Indemnifying Party's receipt of notice of
the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

If the Indemnifying Party assumes the investigation and defence of a Third
Party Claim: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Indemnifying Party will pay for all costs and expenses of the
investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim except that the
Indemnifying Party will not, so long as it diligently conducts such defence,
be liable to the Indemnified Party for any fees of other counsel or any other
expenses with respect to the defence of the Third Party Claim, incurred by the
Indemnified Party after the date the Indemnifying Party validly exercised its
right to assume the investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim prior to the date the
Indemnifying Party validly exercised its right to assume the investigation and
defence of the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

If the Indemnified Party undertakes the defence of the Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any compromise or settlement of the
Third Party Claim effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

The Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to compromise and settle or to
cause a compromise and settlement of a Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the terms of the compromise and settlement require only the payment of money
for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to full indemnification under this
Agreement; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Indemnified Party is not required to admit any wrongdoing, take or refrain
from taking any action, acknowledge any rights of the Person making the Third
Party Claim or waive any rights that the Indemnified Party may have against
the Person making the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to keep the other fully
informed of the status of any Third Party Claim and any related proceedings.
If the Indemnifying Party assumes the investigation and defence of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, at the request and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, use its reasonable efforts to make available to the
Indemnifying Party, on a timely basis, those employees whose assistance,
testimony or presence is necessary to assist the Indemnifying Party in
investigating and defending the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party
shall, at the request and expense of the Indemnifying Party, make available to
the Indemnifying Party, or its representatives, on a timely basis all
documents, records and other materials in the possession, control or power of
the Indemnified Party, reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party for its
use solely in defending any Third Party Claim which it has elected to assume
the investigation and defence of. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate on a
timely basis with the Indemnifying Party in the defence of any Third Party
Claim.

Section 9.8

|

Exclusion of Other Remedies. 

Except as provided in this Section 9.8, Section 10.4 and in Section 12.15,
following Closing, the indemnities provided in Section 9.2 and Section 9.3
constitute the only remedy of the Purchaser or the Vendors, respectively,
against a Party in the event of any breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of such Party contained in this Agreement, except in the
case of willful breach or fraudulent misrepresentation. The Parties
acknowledge that the failure to comply with a covenant or obligation contained
in this Agreement may give rise to irreparable injury to a Party inadequately
compensable in damages. Accordingly, a Party may seek to enforce the
performance of this Agreement by injunction or specific performance upon
application to a court of competent jurisdiction without proof of actual
damage (and without requirement of posting a bond or other security). Except
as set forth in this Section 9.8, each of the Purchaser and the Vendors
expressly waives and renounces any other remedies whatsoever, whether at law
or in equity, which it would otherwise be entitled to as against any other
Party.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.9

|

One Recovery. 

An Indemnified Party is not entitled to double recovery for any claims even
though they may have resulted from the breach of more than one of the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Indemnifying
Party in this Agreement. No Party has any liability or obligation with respect
to any claim for indemnification to the extent that such matter was reflected
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price in Section 2.8.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.10

|

Duty to Mitigate. 

Nothing in this Agreement in any way restricts or limits the general
obligation at Law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any loss which it may
suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an Indemnifying Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement. If any claim can be reduced by any recovery, settlement
or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, the Indemnified
Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to enforce such recovery,
settlement or payment and the amount of any Damages of the Indemnified Party
will be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party, provided that this Section 9.10 does not impose a
requirement on any Party to purchase a reasonable amount or any amount of
insurance. In addition, the Purchaser shall not be required pursuant to this
Section 9.10 to pay any Tax for which the Vendors are liable, or for which the
Vendors are required to indemnify the Purchaser. 
| 
---|--- 

Section 9.11

|

Tax Effect. 

The amount of any Damages of the Indemnified Party will be reduced by (i) the
amount of tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Damages, and (ii) the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually
received (net of any costs of enforcement, deductibles and retro-premium
adjustments) by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Damages. For
purposes hereof, "tax benefits" shall mean any refund or credit of Taxes to be
paid or any reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would be owed by
the Indemnified Party or any of the Purchased Corporations, computed at the
highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.12

|

Independent Significance. 

The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
contained in this Agreement has independent significance. If any Party has
breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party has not
breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.13

|

No Contribution. 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after the Closing no Vendor
shall have, and each hereby irrevocably waives, any claims, causes of action
and rights to sue or seek contribution, reimbursement or indemnification
against or from any of the Purchased Corporations for any Damages incurred,
suffered, paid, sustained or indemnified by the Vendor in connection with,
arising out of, based upon, relating to or otherwise involving this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.14

|

Adjustment to Purchase Price. 

Any payment made by any Vendor as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article 9 will constitute a dollar-for-dollar decrease of the Purchase Price
and any payment made by the Purchaser as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article 9 will constitute a dollar-for-dollar increase of the Purchase
Price.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.15

|

Indemnity Payments to Vendor Representative. 

Any payment made by the Purchaser as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article 9 will be paid to, or as directed by, the Vendor Representative in
trust for the Vendors, in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, and for
greater certainty, Section 10.4(5) will apply. 

ARTICLE 10 
POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

| 
---|--- 

Section 10.1

|

Access to Books and Records. 

For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or for such longer
period as may be required by Law, the Purchaser will retain all original books
and records relating to the Purchased Corporations existing on the Closing
Date. So long as any such books and records are retained by the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement, each Vendor has the right to inspect and to make
copies (at its own expense) of them at any time upon reasonable request during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice for any proper purpose and
without undue interference to the business operations of any Purchased
Corporation. The Purchaser has the right to have its representatives present
during any such inspection.

| 
---|--- 

Section 10.2

|

Director and Officer Indemnification. 

For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit the Purchased Corporations, or any successor or assign by
amalgamation or otherwise, to amend, repeal or modify any provision in the
Purchased Corporations' articles of incorporation or by-laws relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of any current or former officer or director
(unless required by law), it being the intent of the Parties that the officers
and directors of the Purchased Corporations continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the law. If the
Purchased Corporations or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other Person or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of such Purchased Corporation assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 10.2. This Section 10.2 is intended for
the benefit of, and is enforceable by, each current and former officer and
director of the Purchased Corporations and his or her heirs, executors and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
had by contract or otherwise.

| 
---|--- 

Section 10.3

|

Change of Name. 

Forthwith following Closing, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall effect a change of the name of each of
Tricor Canada and Tricor US to names other than names containing the word
"Tricor" and shall provide to Fund IV Canada and Fund IV US copies of the
amendments to each such corporation's constating documents evidencing such
changes of name. The Purchaser agrees that from and after the Closing neither
it, nor any of its affiliates, will, without the express written consent of
the Fund IV Canada and Fund IV US, use the word "Tricor" or any similar words.

| 
---|--- 

Section 10.4

|

Post-Closing LTIP Payments and Refunds of Excess LTIP Payments. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

From time to time following Closing, the Vendor Representative shall
determine: 
| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the amount of any LTIP Bonus Amounts to be paid to Employees who have entered
into LTIP Agreements over and above the amounts determined under Section
2.2(c); and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the amount of any refunds payable to Golden Boy by Employees who have entered
into LTIP Agreements in respect of LTIP Bonus Amounts previously paid to such
Employees. 

The Purchaser shall, and shall cause Golden Boy to, provide such co-operation
and information to the Vendor Representative as the Vendor Representative may
reasonably request for the purposes of making the determinations set forth in
this Section 10.4(1).

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Subject to Section 10.4(3) and Section 10.4(4), the Purchaser shall cause
Golden Boy to pay when due in accordance with the LTIP Agreements all LTIP
Bonus Amount payments required to be made after Closing to each Employee who
is a party to an LTIP Agreement, including, but not limited to, the LTIP
Holdback Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

If the payment of any LTIP Bonus Amounts are required to be made after Closing
pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(ii) of the LTIP Agreements, the Purchaser shall
have no obligation under Section 10.4(2) unless and until the Vendor
Representative has paid to the Purchaser, or as the Purchaser has directed, an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of such payments of LTIP Bonus Amounts
less the LTIP Holdback Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

If payments of any LTIP Bonus Amounts are required to be made after Closing
pursuant to Section 3.7(b) of the LTIP Agreements, the Purchaser shall have no
obligation under Section 10.4(2) unless and until the Vendor Representative
has paid to the Purchaser, or as the Purchaser has directed, or has directed
the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser or as the Purchaser has directed from
funds otherwise payable by the Escrow Agent to the Vendor Representative, an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of such payments of LTIP Bonus Amounts. 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

If: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

a provision of this Agreement requires the Purchaser to make a payment to, or
to the direction of, the Vendor Representative in connection with an increase
to the Purchase Price other than pursuant to Section 2.8; 

then:

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

pursuant to Section 10.4(1), the Vendor Representative will determine the sum
of all payments which Golden Boy will be required to make pursuant to Section
3.7(a)(ii) and Section 3.7(b) of the LTIP Agreements on account of such
increase to the Purchase Price, and the amount of the payment to be required
to be paid to, or to the direction of, the Vendor Representative shall be
reduced by an amount equal to that sum; 
| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

the Purchaser will pay the balance of the increase of the Purchase Price to
the Vendor Representative, in trust for the Vendors, in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares; and 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Fund IV Canada, Fund IV US and Harris will each direct the Vendor
Representative to pay to Manulife from the amount otherwise due to such Vendor
in accordance with that Vendor's share of the amount released from escrow
(being that Vendor's Pro Rata Share as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.9(1))
the amount determined under the following formula: 

Manulife Payment = (A - B) X C

Where:

A = Such Vendor's LTIP Responsibility Percentage;

B = Such Vendor's Pro Rata Share percentage; and

| 
---|--- 

C =

|

an amount equal to the amount determined under Section 10.4(5)(b) 

such that Manulife will receive its Pro-Rata Share of the amount of the
increase in Purchase Price contemplated under Section 10.4(5)(a) without any
reduction on account of the deduction of the amounts determined under Section
10.4(5)(b).

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

If and to the extent that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the aggregate LTIP Bonus Amount paid and payable by Golden Boy is greater than
the amount required to be paid under the LTIP Agreements, and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Vendor Representative has directly paid the Purchaser an amount equal to
the difference (for greater certainty, other than by way of directing the
Escrow Agent to pay Purchaser an amount equal to the difference), 

the Vendors will severally indemnify the Vendor Representative for an amount
equal to the difference. For the purposes of this Section 10.4(6), the word
"severally" means that each Vendor shall only be responsible or liable for
that portion of the difference as is equal to that Vendor's LTIP
Responsibility Percentage.

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

The Purchaser shall cause Golden Boy to, at the cost of the Vendors, take all
such actions as the Vendor Representative may reasonably request in order to
collect all refunds payable to Golden Boy by Employees who have entered into
LTIP Agreements in respect of LTIP Bonus Amounts previously paid to such
Employees, including assigning its right to receive such refunds to the Vendor
Representative, in writing, for enforcement purposes. Where refund amounts
contemplated under this Section 10.4(7) are paid to Golden Boy, the Purchaser
shall cause Golden Boy to forthwith pay-over any such amounts to the Vendor
Representative for the benefit of the Vendors net of any Taxes payable by
Golden Boy as a result of the receipt of such refund. Any amounts received or
paid over to the Vendor Representative pursuant to this Section 10.4(7) shall
be paid to the Vendors based on each Vendor's LTIP Responsibility Percentage. 
| 
---|--- 

Section 10.5

|

Confidentiality. 

Each Vendor acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the
Confidential Company Information and agrees, that from and after the Closing,
such Vendor shall: (i) keep the Confidential Company Information confidential;
(ii) not use the Confidential Company Information for any reason or purpose,
except for a Permitted Purpose; and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, not
disclose the Confidential Company Information to any Person, except for a
Permitted Purpose or with the Purchaser's prior written consent. This Section
10.5 shall not apply to that part of the Confidential Company Information that
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach
of this Section 10.5 by any of the Vendors. Confidential Company Information
shall not be deemed "generally available to the public" merely because it is
included or incorporated in more general information that is publicly
available or because it combines features which individually may be publicly
available. If a Vendor becomes compelled in any action or proceeding to make
any disclosure that is prohibited by this Section 10.5, such Vendor shall, to
the extent legally permissible, provide the Purchaser with prompt notice of
such compulsion so that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order
or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 10.5. In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, such
Vendor may disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential
Company Information that, based upon the opinion of such Vendor's counsel,
such Vendor is legally compelled to disclose; provided, however, that such
Vendor shall use its best efforts to obtain written assurance that any Person
to whom any Confidential Company Information is so disclosed shall accord
confidential treatment to such Confidential Company Information. Nothing in
this Section 10.5 shall diminish the protections and benefits under applicable
Law to which any trade secret of any of the Purchased Corporations is
entitled. If any information that the Purchaser or any of the Purchased
Corporations asserts to be a trade secret under applicable Law is found by a
court of competent jurisdiction not to be such a trade secret, such
information shall nonetheless be considered Confidential Company Information
for purposes of this Section 10.5.

For the purpose of this Section, "Permitted Purpose" means any purpose in
connection with:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

a dispute or litigation relating to or arising out of this Agreement; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

regulatory or legal compliance including, but not limited to, audits by the
SEC or another Governmental Entity; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

the Vendors' (and their affiliates') reporting and marketing activities with
their limited partners and with investors who may potentially become limited
partners, provided, in the latter case, that such investors agree to keep the
Confidential Company Information confidential by way of a written
confidentiality agreement prior to disclosure of any Confidential Company
Information to such investors. 
| 
---|--- 

Section 10.6

|

Further Assurances. 

From time to time after the Closing Date, each Party will, at the request of
any other Party, execute and deliver such additional conveyances, transfers
and other assurances as may be reasonably required to effectively transfer the
Purchased Shares to the Purchaser and carry out the intent of this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

Section 10.7

|

Blaine Facility Fire Insurance Proceeds. 

If insurance proceeds relating to the December 26, 2012 fire at Golden Boy's
Blaine, WA facility are paid to the Purchaser or any of its successors or
affiliates following the Closing, the Purchaser will pay the amount of such
proceeds by wire transfer, direct deposit, certified cheque or bank draft to,
or to the direction of the Vendor Representative in trust for the Vendors, in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, within ten (10) Business Days following
the receipt of such proceeds, as a dollar-for-dollar increase of the Purchase
Price, and for greater certainty, Section 10.4(5) will apply.

| 
---|--- 

Section 10.8

|

Refund of Customs Accruals. 

Promptly following the time at which the last of the customs matters disclosed
in Section 3.1(yy) of the Disclosure Letter is settled or finalized, the
Purchaser will provide the Vendor Representative with a written notice
containing a description of the final outcome of each of those matters and its
calculation as to the amount of any Customs Duties which were finally paid or
payable in respect of each such matter. The procedures and time periods
described in Section 2.7(2) to Section 2.7(7) for preparation of the Closing
Net Working Capital shall apply mutatis mutandis to the review of Purchaser's
calculation and to any dispute of Purchaser's calculation between the
Purchaser and the Vendor Representative. If and to the extent that the accrual
in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement relating to the customs matters
disclosed in Section 3.1(yy) of the Disclosure Letter is greater than the
aggregate amount of the Customs Duties which were payable in respect of each
such matter, the Purchaser will pay the amount of such difference to, or to
the direction of, the Vendor Representative (in trust for the Vendors, in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares) as an increase to the Purchase Price,
by wire transfer, direct deposit, certified cheque or bank draft within five
(5) Business Days of the date of the written notice, and for greater
certainty, Section 10.4(5) will apply.

| 
---|--- 

Section 10.9

|

No Purchases of Shares of Post Holdings, Inc. 

None of Fund IV Canada, any general partner of Fund IV Canada, Fund IV US, any
general partner of Fund IV US or the Vendor Representative shall for a period
of at least thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date knowingly purchase
for its own account, either directly or indirectly, (a) any share of the
capital stock of Guarantor, (b) any indebtedness of Guarantor, (c) any option,
warrant, convertible security, exchangeable security, subscription right,
conversion right or privilege, exchange right, or other right, agreement,
arrangement, commitment, obligation or contract that could require Guarantor
to issue any of its capital stock, (d) any other security convertible into,
exchangeable or exercisable for, or representing the right to subscribe for
any capital stock of Guarantor, (e) any statutory pre-emptive right or pre-
emptive right granted under Guarantor's organizational documents or pursuant
to contract, (f) any stock option, stock appreciation right, phantom stock,
profit participation, or other similar right with respect to Guarantor, or (g)
any property more than 10% of the fair market value of which is attributable
to any property or properties owned by any subsidiary of Tricor Canada on the
Closing Date, or any property substituted for, or that derives its value from,
directly or indirectly any such property or properties. For greater certainty,
the limited partners of Fund IV Canada and Fund IV US are not restricted from
purchasing, directly or indirectly, any of the items listed in (a) through
(g), above. 

ARTICLE 11 
TAX MATTERS

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.1

|

Straddle Period. 

In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a ''Straddle Period''), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the Purchase Corporations for the
Vendor Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books
as of 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on the Closing Date and the preparation of
notional tax returns in respect of the period ending at such time (and for
such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through
entity in which the Purchased Corporations holds a beneficial interest shall
be deemed to terminate at such time). Taxes of the Purchased Corporations
other than those contemplated in the previous sentence for a Straddle Period
that relates to the Vendor Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.2

|

Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Purchased Corporations that are filed after the
Closing Date and which relate to a Vendor Tax Period. The Purchaser shall
provide copies of such returns to the Vendor Representative at least ten (10)
days prior to the date on which such returns are due (including extensions)
and shall permit the Vendor Representative to review and comment on each such
Tax Return. Without duplication of any amount which reduced the Purchase Price
pursuant any other provision of this Agreement, the Vendors (in accordance
with their Pro Rata Shares) shall pay to the Purchaser in immediately
available funds the amount of any Taxes due and payable in respect of any
Vendor Tax Period pursuant to each such Tax Return. Any such payment by any
Vendor pursuant to this Section 11.2 shall constitute a refund of, and a
dollar-for-dollar decrease of, the Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

The Purchaser and the Vendors and their affiliates shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 11.2 and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Purchased Corporations and the Vendors agree
(a) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Purchased Corporations relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser or the Vendors, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity, and (B)
to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, the Purchased Corporations or the Vendors, as the case may be, shall
allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records. 
| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

The Purchaser and the Vendors further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby); provided that the obligation
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed shall not
impose on the Purchaser, or the Purchased Corporations, any duty to pay any
Tax with respect to any Vendor Tax Period on behalf of the Purchased
Corporations on amounts for which Vendors are liable pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 11 in order to limit the accrual of interest and
penalties. 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

The Purchaser and the Vendors further agree, upon request, to provide the
other Party with all information that either Party may be required to report
pursuant to Code §6043, or Code §6043A, or Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.3

|

Tax Refunds. 

If any of the Purchased Corporations receive any refund of Taxes in respect of
any Vendor Tax Period which is not included as a Current Asset in the Closing
Net Working Capital Statement, such Purchased Corporation will calculate the
difference between the amount of the refund (less any reasonable fees or
expenses incurred by the Purchaser or any of the Purchased Corporations in
connection with such refund) and any amount in respect of the refund for that
period recorded as an asset or a reduction in the liabilities in the Closing
Net Working Capital Statement. The Purchase Price will be increased by an
amount equal to the difference and the Purchaser will pay to, or to the
direction of, the Vendor Representative (in trust for the Vendors, in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares) the amount of the difference by way of
a wire transfer or direct deposit of immediately available funds within 10
Business Days of the Purchased Corporation receiving the refund, for greater
certainty, Section 10.4(5) will apply.

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.4

|

Tax Shortfalls. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

In this Agreement, "Tax Shortfall" means any Taxes that are imposed on,
assessed against, or collected from a Purchased Corporation (or for which any
Purchased Corporation may otherwise be liable) in respect of a Vendor Tax
Period that are not included as a liability in the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement (excluding any reserve for future income taxes/deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income), except
for the following: 
| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Taxes imposed with respect to actions taken outside the ordinary course of
business by any Purchased Corporation: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

on the Closing Date, but after the Closing; or 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

resulting from or relating to the Pre-Closing Reorganization or 338(g)
Election; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Taxes that would not have been payable in respect of a Vendor Tax Period but
for: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

a change in the Tax reporting practices of any Purchased Corporation occurring
after Closing except as required to comply with Tax Laws or to correct prior
filing deficiencies that were not in accordance with Tax Laws; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

a failure by the Purchaser or any of the Purchased Corporations to file, after
Closing and within the time prescribed for doing so, any Tax Return; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Taxes included in the LTIP Bonus Amount or in the STIP Bonus Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes imposed on, assessed against, or collected
from a Purchased Corporation in respect of a Vendor Tax Period include: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

all Taxes imposed on, assessed against, or collected from a Purchased
Corporation with respect to any taxable period ending before the Closing Date;
and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the amount of Taxes imposed on, assessed against, or collected from a
Purchased Corporation allocable to a Vendor Tax Period determined under
Article 11 with respect to any Straddle Period included in the Vendor Tax
Period. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

To the extent that the Purchaser seeks indemnification for a Tax Shortfall
under Article 9, the Tax Shortfall will be treated as a Third Party Claim,
and, for greater certainty, the Vendors will be entitled to investigate,
appeal and/or defend against any assessments, judgment or actions by any
Governmental Entity imposing the Taxes with respect to which the Purchaser is
seeking indemnification, all in accordance with Section 9.7. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.5

|

Tax-Sharing Agreements. 

All Tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving
a Purchased Corporation shall be terminated by the Vendors as of the Closing
Date and, after the Closing Date, no Purchased Corporation shall be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder. 
| 
---|--- 

Section 11.6

|

Certain Taxes and Fees. 

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in
connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization or 338(g) Election shall be
paid by the Purchaser when due, and the Purchaser will, at its own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes, fees and charges.

|

Section 11.7

|

CRA Assessments. 

If the CRA assesses any Purchased Corporation:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

under subsection 185.1(1) of the Tax Act in respect of an "excessive eligible
dividend designation" within the meaning of subsection 89(1) of the Tax Act in
respect of any dividend paid on or before Closing and either the Purchaser or
the Vendors request that an election be made under subsection 185.1(2) of the
Tax Act in respect of such dividend; or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

under subsection 184(2) of the Tax Act in respect of a capital dividend paid
on or before Closing in respect of which any Purchased Corporation made a
capital dividend election under subsection 83(2) of the Tax Act in excess of
the amount in such corporation's capital dividend account and either the
Purchaser or the Vendors request that an election be made under subsection
184(3) of the Tax Act in respect of such dividend; 

the Purchased Corporation so assessed and each of its shareholders shall file
such election in the form and within the time prescribed under the Tax Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the filing of the election by the particular
corporation so assessed and each of its shareholders does not relieve the
Vendors from their indemnification obligations to the Purchaser to the extent
that the particular corporation or the Purchaser is liable to pay any Tax or
otherwise suffers any loss or damage as a result of such excessive eligible
dividend election or capital dividend election.

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.8

|

Code §338 Election. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to make an
election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code for any or all of the
Purchased Corporations (the "338(g) Election"); provided, the Purchaser and
the Purchased Corporations shall be obliged to pay, without the right to be
indemnified, all Taxes resulting from such election. If the Purchaser makes a
338(g) Election, the Purchaser shall provide the Vendors with a copy of all
relevant documents relating to such election. 
| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no 338(g) Election shall be permitted (or
otherwise made) with respect to Tricor Canada's acquisition of the shares of
Tricor US pursuant to the Pre-Closing Reorganization. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.9

|

Tax Benefits from LTIP and STIP. 

Purchaser shall pay to Vendor Representative cash equal to the actual net
reduction in Taxes realized by Purchaser or any or all of the Purchased
Corporations, if any, when, if and as realized by Purchaser or the Purchased
Corporations as a result of any deductions attributable to payment of the LTIP
Bonus Amount or STIP Bonus Amount. Purchaser shall provide Vendor
Representative with written notice and Purchaser's calculation of the amount
of the Tax benefit actually realized by Purchaser or the Purchased Companies
within thirty (30) days following the receipt of a notice of assessment in
respect of each taxation year. The procedures and time periods described in
Section 2.7(2) to Section 2.7(7) for preparation of the Closing Net Working
Capital shall apply mutatis mutandis to the review of Purchaser's calculation
and to any dispute of Purchaser's calculation between Purchaser and Vendor
Representative. The Purchaser shall pay to the Vendors in trust for the Vendor
Representative, in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination of any Tax benefit pursuant to
Section 2.7 the amount of such Tax benefit.

A Notice is deemed to be given and received (i) if sent by personal delivery
or courier, on the date of delivery if it is a Business Day and the delivery
was made prior to 4:00 p.m. (local time in place of receipt) and otherwise on
the next Business Day, or (ii) if sent by facsimile, on the Business Day
following the date of confirmation of transmission by the originating
facsimile. A Party may change its address for service from time to time by
providing a Notice in accordance with the foregoing. Any subsequent Notice
must be sent to the Party at its changed address. Any element of a Party's
address that is not specifically changed in a Notice will be assumed not to be
changed. Sending a copy of a Notice to a Party's legal counsel as contemplated
above is for information purposes only and does not constitute delivery of the
Notice to that Party. The failure to send a copy of a Notice to legal counsel
does not invalidate delivery of that Notice to a Party.

Section 12.2

|

Time of the Essence. 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

Section 12.3

Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) where public disclosure is required by Law
or a Governmental Entity, the Party required to make the public disclosure
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of the
other Party as to the form, nature and extent of the disclosure; and (ii) the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Tricor Pacific Capital Inc. and/or
its affiliates may, on or after the Closing, make such announcements or public

discussions relating to the transaction contemplated hereby, or (B) public
announcement of the execution of this Agreement (provided this authorization
is not intended to permit disclosure of any information to the extent not

|

Personal Information Privacy Covenants 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Each Disclosing Party acknowledges and confirms that the disclosure of
Transferred Information is necessary for the purposes of determining if the

disclosure of Transferred Information relates solely to the carrying on of the
business and the completion of the transactions contemplated herein. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each Disclosing Party covenants and agrees to, upon request, use reasonable
efforts to advise the Recipient of all documented purposes for which the
Transferred Information was initially collected from or in respect of the

documented purposes where the Disclosing Party has notified the individual of
such additional purpose, and where required by law, obtained the consent of
such individual to such use or disclosure. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

In addition to its other obligations hereunder, Recipient covenants and agrees
to: (i) prior to the completion of the transactions contemplated herein,
collect, use and disclose the Transferred Information solely for the purpose
of reviewing and completing the transactions contemplated herein, including
for the purpose of determining to complete such transactions; (ii) after the
completion of the transactions contemplated herein, collect, use and disclose
the Transferred Information only for those purposes for which the Transferred
Information was initially collected from or in respect of the individual to
which such Transferred Information relates or for the completion of the
transactions contemplated herein, unless (A) the Disclosing Party or Recipient
have first notified such individual of such additional purpose, and where
required by Laws, obtained the consent of such individual to such additional
purpose, or (B) such use or disclosure is permitted or authorized by law,
without notice to, or consent from, such individual; (iii) where required by
law, promptly notify the individuals to whom the Transferred Information
relates that the transactions contemplated herein have taken place and that

or destroy the Transferred Information, at the option of the Disclosing Party,
should the transactions contemplated herein not be completed. 
| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Recipient shall at all times keep strictly confidential all Transferred
Information provided to it, and shall instruct those employees or advisors
responsible for processing such Transferred Information to protect the
confidentiality of such information in a manner consistent with the
Recipient's obligations hereunder and according to applicable Laws.

---|--- 

(e)

|

Recipient shall ensure that access to the Disclosed Personal Information shall
be restricted to those employees or advisors of the respective Recipient who
have a bona fide need to access such information in order to complete the
transactions contemplated herein. 

"Transferred Information" means the personal information (namely, information
about an identifiable individual other than their business contact information
when used or disclosed for the purpose of contacting such individual in that
individual's capacity as an employee or an official of an organization and for
no other purpose) to be disclosed or conveyed to one Party or any of its
representatives or agents (a "Recipient") by or on behalf of another Party (a
"Disclosing Party") as a result of or in conjunction with the transactions
contemplated herein, and includes all such personal information disclosed to
the Recipient prior to the execution of this Agreement;

Section 12.5

|

Third Party Beneficiaries. 

Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Section 10.2 (i)
the Vendors and the Purchaser intend that this Agreement will not benefit or
create any right or cause of action in favour of any Person, other than the
Parties; and (ii) no Person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled to rely
on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing
or other forum. To the extent required by law to give full effect to these
direct rights, the Vendors and the Purchaser agree and acknowledge that they
are acting as agent and/or as trustee of their respective Indemnified Parties.

Section 12.8

|

Waiver. 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Party's
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

| 
---|--- 

Section 12.9

|

Non-Merger. 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants,

express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in
