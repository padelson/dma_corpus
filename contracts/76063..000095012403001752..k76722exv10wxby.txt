line items in Sections 1.1(b)(ii) or 1.1(b)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, as applicable. For purposes of the Net Working Capital calculation,

disagreement with respect to the calculation of the Estimated Adjustment
Amount as of the Closing, the Estimated Purchase Price paid pursuant to
Section 2.4 shall be based on the amount of the Estimated Adjustment Amount
delivered to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.3, as adjusted to reflect any
changes to the Estimated Adjustment Amount agreed to by the parties prior to
Closing.   Section 2.4 Estimated Purchase Price.   In consideration of the
aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery to Buyer of the

of Total Debt as of September 30, 2002 ($1,165,519,106) (the "Base Total

amount that is positive or negative. The Estimated Purchase Price will be
payable at the Closing by wire transfer of same day funds to an account or
accounts and in such amounts as designated by Seller. Seller shall designate
such account or accounts and amounts in writing at least two (2) Business
Days prior to Closing.   Section 2.5 Post-Closing Adjustment.   (a) As
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event
within sixty (60) days thereafter, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
(i) a consolidated balance sheet of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries
as of the close of business on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the "Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) a calculation of the "Closing
Adjustment Amount," which shall mean the amount equal to (a) the Net Working
Capital Amount as of the Closing Date, as reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet, minus (b) the amount of the Base Net Working Capital Amount, plus (c)
the amount of the Base Total Debt, minus (d) the Total Debt as of the Closing
Date, as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, which calculation may result
in an amount that is positive or negative (together with reasonable back-up
information providing the basis for such balance sheet and calculations). In
order for Seller to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and calculate the
Closing Adjustment Amount, Buyer will provide to Seller and Seller\'s
accountants prompt and full access to the personnel, accountants and books
and records of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries (and shall
provide copies of the applicable portions of such books and records as may be
reasonably requested), to the extent reasonably related to the preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Adjustment
Amount (and the elements of such calculation). In order for Buyer to review

Adjustment Amount, Seller will provide to Buyer and Buyer\'s accountants
prompt and full access to the personnel, accountants and books and records
used by Seller (and shall provide copies of the applicable portions of such
books and records as may be reasonably requested), to the extent reasonably
related to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation
of the Closing Adjustment Amount (and the elements of such calculation). The
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Adjustment Amount shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Pro Forma Adjusted Balance Sheet (and subject to the
exceptions from GAAP relating to the adjustments reflected on the Pro Forma
Adjusted Balance Sheet).     19    (b) Disputes. If Buyer disagrees
with the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount, it shall notify Seller
of such disagreement in writing within thirty (30) days after its receipt of
the Closing Balance Sheet, which notice shall set forth in detail the
particulars of such disagreement. In the event that Buyer does not provide
such a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, Buyer shall
be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of
the Closing Adjustment Amount (and each element of such calculation),
respectively delivered by Seller, which shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of
disagreement is timely provided by Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall use their
reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount (or any element
thereof). If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then, upon the written request of either party, an independent
accounting firm (not providing services to Buyer or Seller) acceptable to
Buyer and Seller (the "Auditor") shall resolve any remaining disagreements.
The Auditor shall determine as promptly as practicable (but in any event
within sixty (60) days) following the date on which such dispute is referred
to the Auditor, based solely on written submissions, which shall be forwarded
by Buyer and Seller to the Auditor within thirty (30) days following the
Auditor\'s selection, whether the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in
accordance with the standards set forth in this Section 2.5 with respect to
any items identified as disputed in the notice of disagreement and not
previously resolved by Buyer and Seller, and if not, whether and to what
extent (if any) the Closing Adjustment Amount (or any element thereof)
requires adjustment. Each party shall bear its own expenses and the fees and
expenses of its own representatives and experts in connection with the
preparation, review, dispute (if any) and final determination of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Adjustment Amount. The parties shall share the
costs, expenses and fees of the Auditor in inverse proportion to the
extent to which their respective positions are sustained (e.g., if Seller\'s
position is one hundred percent (100%) sustained, it shall bear none of such
costs, expenses, and fees of the Auditor). The determination of the Auditor
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The Auditor\'s
determination of the amount of the Closing Adjustment Amount shall then be
deemed to be the Closing Adjustment Amount for purposes of this Section 2.5.
The date on which such items are accepted or finally determined in accordance
with this Section 2.5 is referred as to the "Determination Date." As used in
this Agreement, the term "reasonable best efforts" shall not include efforts
which require the performing party (i) to do any act that is unreasonable
under the circumstances, (ii) to make any capital contribution not expressly
contemplated hereunder, (iii) to amend or waive any rights under this
Agreement, or (iv) to incur or expend any funds other than reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in satisfying its obligation hereunder, including
the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of accountants, counsel and
other professionals.   (c) Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Estimated
Adjustment Amount is (x) less than the Closing Adjustment Amount, then the
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such shortfall (the "Buyer
Adjustment") or (y) greater than the Closing Adjustment Amount, then Seller
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such excess (the "Seller
Adjustment").      20    (d) Adjustment Amounts. The Estimated
Purchase Price minus the Seller Adjustment, if any, plus the Buyer
Adjustment, if any, shall equal the "Purchase Price." The Seller Adjustment,
if any, and the Buyer Adjustment, if any, shall bear simple interest at a
rate equal to daily average one month LIBOR plus one percent (1%) per annum
measured from the Closing Date to the date of such payment. Amounts owing by
Seller, if any, pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be paid by Seller by
delivery of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer
within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date. Amounts owing by
Buyer, if any, pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be paid by Buyer by
delivery of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller
within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date.   Section 2.6

Exchange.   With the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, the rights of Buyer under this Agreement may be
assigned in whole or in part to Southern Union. In the event Seller consents
to such assignment to Southern Union pursuant to Section 9.6 of this
Agreement, Buyer may desire that the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and the Related Agreements be accomplished in a manner enabling
Southern Union\'s purchase to qualify as part of a like-kind exchange of
property covered by Section 1031 of the Code. Seller agrees to cooperate and
consider in good faith any reasonable request or proposal made by Southern
Union in connection with efforts to effect such like-kind exchange, including
any reasonable use of a "qualified intermediary", an "exchange accommodation
titleholder" or a "qualified exchange accommodation agreement" within the
meaning of the United States Treasury Regulations and related authority;
provided, however, that Seller shall have no obligation to take (or agree to
take) any action that, in its reasonable discretion, may create any adverse
consequences to the Seller, including but not limited to adverse Tax,
financial or regulatory consequences for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Related Agreements or may cause an unreasonable delay

the Related Agreements. Buyer agrees that it will reimburse Seller for any
out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection its cooperation, including but not
limited to legal fees, opinions of counsel or other costs incurred
in implementing Buyer\'s proposals. Notwithstanding anything herein, the

the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agree to use, and will cause its Affiliates to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable under Applicable
Law and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
including the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices
required to be filed by such party in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the taking of all appropriate action
necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy each of the conditions to Closing
that are to be satisfied by that party or any of its Affiliates and the
taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any approvals, consents,
orders, exemptions or waivers of Governmental Authorities and any other
Person required to be obtained by such party in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the issuance and
delivery of the Southern Union Shares.   (b) To the extent required by the
HSR Act, each party shall (i) file or cause to be filed, as promptly as
practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the
Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, any
additional reports and other documents required to be filed by such party
under the HSR Act concerning the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
promptly comply with or cause to be complied with any requests by the Federal
Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice for additional
information concerning such transactions. The filing fees payable in
connection with the filings required by the HSR      47       Act
in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby shall be borne
by Buyer. Each party shall have a right to review in advance all
characterizations of the information relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which appear in Items 2 and 3 of the Antitrust
Improvements Act Notification and Report Form for certain mergers and
acquisitions made in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
For the avoidance of doubt, no party shall be required to provide to any
other party a copy of any documents filed by it pursuant to Item 4(c) the of
the Antitrust Improvements Act Notification and Report Form. Subject to (c)
below, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly consult
with the other with respect to, provide any necessary information with
respect to, and provide copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Authority or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Related
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each party
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, with respect to
a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of any party to this Agreement or any Related
Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof, as the case may be (including by pursuing any available
appeal process). Each of Buyer and Southern Union shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
use their reasonable best efforts to, promptly take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary to comply with any requests made, or conditions set, by a
Governmental Authority to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, subject to the receipt of all required third party consents
(including those of lenders, shareholders and partners), with respect to
Panhandle (but subject to Section 6.1 (b)) and each Section 5.4 (b) Person,
the divestiture of assets. Each party agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to procure any third-party consents required in the preceding
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Southern Union or
its Subsidiaries (i) shall be required to divest any asset or modify any
arrangement with respect to any of its respective operations that would have
a material adverse impact on the Section 5.4 (b) Person which holds the asset
to be divested or is a party to the arrangement to be modified or on any
other Section 5.4 (b) Person or (ii) shall be required to take or refrain
from taking any action if such action or refraining would have a material
adverse impact on the Section 5.4 (b) Person so acting or refraining or on
any other Section 5.4 (b) Person. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event
shall any of Buyer\'s Affiliates be required to take any action to obtain the
consent or approval of any Governmental Authority to the transactions
contemplated hereby if such Governmental Authority imposes on such Affiliate
as a condition to obtaining any such consent any limitations or conditions
materially adverse to the businesses and activities engaged in by Southern
Union and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (any such condition or limitation
described in this paragraph being referred to herein as a "Burdensome
Condition").   (c) Without limiting the generality of the
undertakings pursuant to this Section 5.4 and subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections and limitations set forth in Section 5.4 (b)
above, Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall each furnish to
the parties to this Agreement such necessary information and reasonable
assistance a party may request in connection with the foregoing and, shall
each provide    48     counsel for the other party with copies of all
filings made by such party or such Affiliate, and all correspondence between
such party or such Affiliate (and its advisors) with any Governmental
Authority and any other information supplied by such party and such party\'s
Affiliates to a Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, provided, however, that materials may
be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of Panhandle or
the Panhandle Subsidiaries, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) to remove information that is proprietary. Subject to
Applicable Law and Section 5.4 (b) hereof, each party shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, permit counsel for the other party to review in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
any proposed written communication to any Governmental Authority. Seller,
Buyer and Southern Union agree not to participate, or to permit their
Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion, either
in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, in
case at any time after the Closing Date any further action is necessary or
desirable to secure the approvals from any and all Governmental Authority
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and/or directors of the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all such necessary action.   Section 5.5 Further
Assurances.   On and after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all appropriate actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or appropriate to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the execution of any additional documents or
instruments of any kind, the obtaining of consents which may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions hereof and the
taking of all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to
take by the other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and the Related Agreements, in order to effectuate the
provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   Section 5.6 Employee
Matters.   (a) Buyer shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to
ensure that Buyer maintains or adopts one or more defined contribution plans
and related trust or trusts (the "Buyer Account Plan") effective as of, or as
soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than 15 days after, the
Closing Date for the benefit of the Affected Employees (as defined below).
Following the Closing and as soon as practicable following receipt by Seller
of (i) a copy of a favorable determination letter issued by the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to the Buyer Account Plan or (ii) an opinion,
satisfactory to Seller\'s counsel, of Buyer\'s counsel that the Buyer Account
Plan and its related trust(s) qualify under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a)
of the Code, Seller shall provide each Affected Employee who is a participant
in the Savings and Incentive      49      Plan for Employees of
Consumers Energy and Other CMS Energy Companies ("Seller\'s Savings Plan")
with the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account balance
and to elect to "roll over" such account balance to the Buyer Account Plan,
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Seller\'s Savings Plan
and Applicable Law. The Buyer Account Plan shall accept the "roll over" of
such account balances, including any outstanding plan loans. Seller shall
take all necessary or appropriate action, to the extent consistent
with applicable law, to ensure that any plan loans of Affected Employees
under the Seller\'s Savings Plan shall not be deemed distributed prior to the
rollover opportunity previously described. Seller shall provide Buyer with
copies of such personnel and other records of Seller pertaining to the
Affected Employees and such records of any agent or representative of Seller
pertaining to the Affected Employees, in each case pertaining to Seller\'s
Savings Plan and as Buyer may reasonably request in order to administer and
manage the accounts and assets rolled over to the Buyer Account Plan.   (b)
Subject to Section 5.6 (b)(i) and Section 5.6 (h) below, prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall take all actions necessary to cause the following events
to occur as of the Closing Date, and shall give notice to all Panhandle
Employees that (i) all Affected Employees shall become fully vested with
respect to their account balances under the Seller Savings Plan as of the
Closing Date, (ii) the active participation of the Affected Employees in
those employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are not
sponsored by Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries (such plans,
programs and arrangements, the "Seller Plans") shall terminate on the Closing
Date, and (iii) Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries shall terminate
participation of Affected Employees in the Seller Plans as of the Closing
Date. Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible
(except as provided in Section 8.2 (a)(iii)) for all obligations and
Liabilities under each employee benefit plan listed in Section 3.12 (c) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter in existence as of the Closing Date, and each
employee benefit plan that they establish, maintain or contribute to, on or
after the Closing Date, and no such obligations or Liabilities shall be
assumed or retained by Seller or its Affiliates. Seller shall retain all
obligations or Liabilities and assets with respect to current and former
Panhandle Employees or otherwise under all Seller Plans, and no such
obligations or Liabilities shall be assumed or retained by Buyer or its
affiliates, including after the transactions contemplated hereby, Panhandle
and the Panhandle Subsidiaries.   (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Affected  Employee who is unable to report to work with Buyer as of the
Closing  Date due to disability (each, a "Disabled Employee"), shall continue
to  be eligible for any applicable long-term disability and life insurance 
coverage pursuant to Seller\'s plans until such Disabled Employee  returns to
active employment with Buyer, Panhandle or the Panhandle  Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that in order to be eligible for such  benefits, each such
Disabled Employee, pending approval for long-term  disability benefits or
return to active employment, must continue to  pay all applicable long-term
disability and life insurance premiums due  following the Closing Date for
such coverage pursuant to Seller\'s  long-term disability plan and life
insurance plans. Buyer shall, or  shall cause Panhandle or the
Panhandle     50      Subsidiaries to, (A) pay Disabled Employees who
are on short-term  disability as of the Closing Date the short-term
disability benefits,  if any, that apply under Buyer\'s plans, provided,
however, that such  benefits need not be provided to the extent that they
would duplicate  benefits paid under the Seller Plans, and (B) honor any
continuing pay  or salary obligations and return to work obligations that
apply to any  such Disabled Employees. Any Disabled Employees who are on
short-term  disability as of the Closing Date but who subsequently transition
to  long-term disability shall be eligible for, and covered by, Seller\'s 
long-term disability and life insurance coverage, subject to the  provisions
of this Section 5.6 (b)(i).   (c) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries to continue to employ all of the
Affected Employees as of the Closing Date, other than those Affected
Employees whose employment is covered by a Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
Company collective bargaining agreement as of the Closing Date, in Comparable
Employment for a period of at least one (1) year from and after the Closing
Date, or to pay severance if due in accordance with the terms of the
Separation Allowance Plan for Employees of Panhandle and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries or the Executive Separation Allowance Plan for Employees of
Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
terms of the preceding sentence, Buyer shall cause Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries to employ all Affected Employees who are officers of
Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries in Comparable Employment for a
period of at least two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, or to pay
severance if due in accordance with the terms of the Executive Separation
Allowance Plan for Designated Officers of Panhandle and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries or the Executive Separation Allowance Plan for Designated Senior
Officers of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, as applicable. Employment
of, and severance payments, if any, payable to, Affected Employees whose
employment is covered by a Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company collective
bargaining agreement as of the Closing Date shall be governed by
the applicable collective bargaining agreement.   (d) For no less than one-
year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause Panhandle and
the Panhandle Subsidiaries, to provide the Affected Employees with employee
benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided
under the Seller Plans as such plans are to be in effect for 2003; provided,
however, that Buyer shall not be obligated to replace any equity based plans
in which Affected Employees could participate prior to Closing. With respect
to those employee benefit plans of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates of Buyer ("Buyer Plans") in which Affected Employees may
participate on or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause
Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries to, credit prior service of the
Affected Employees with Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries for purposes
of eligibility and vesting under Buyer Plans and for all purposes with
respect to vacation, sick days, severance and post-employment benefits other
than pensions ("PBOPs") under such Buyer Plans to the extent that such
service was recognized under the analogous Employee Benefit Plans,
provided however that such service need not be credited to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits. Following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries to, honor
the    51        accrued vacation and sick days of the Affected
Employees which remain unused as of the Closing Date to the extent such
accruals are shown on the Closing Balance Sheet. Affected Employees shall
also be given pro rata credit for any deductible or co-insurance payment
amounts payable in respect of the Buyer Plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing Date, they participate in
any Buyer Plan during such plan year for which deductibles or co-payments are
required. Any preexisting condition restrictions and waiting period
limitations which were deemed satisfied with respect to a particular person
under any Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date shall
be deemed satisfied by Buyer and its Affiliates under Buyer Plans
with respect to such person on and after the Closing Date. Seller has
provided Buyer a list of Affected Employees and the status of such Affected
Employees as of the Closing Date under Seller Plans providing for PBOPs, for
the purpose of avoiding duplication of benefits.   (e) Subject to the final
sentence of this Section 5.6 (e), Buyer agrees that, at the request of
Seller, it shall cause Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries to make bonus
payments to the bonus-eligible Affected Employees (as determined by Seller)
for performance in the 2002 calendar year from funds made available by Seller
for such purposes, which bonus payments shall be available as a tax deduction
to Seller and Panhandle attributable to the pre-Closing Tax period. Buyer
shall cause such payments to be made by Panhandle and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries as soon as practicable after Buyer is informed by Seller of the
bonus amounts to be paid to each bonus-eligible Affected Employee by name, as
authorized by the Board of Directors of Parent. Seller and Buyer agree that
the calculation of Net Working Capital Amount shall not reflect the bonus
amounts accrued for the Affected Employees for accounting purposes (the
"Bonus Accrual") and that the Bonus Accrual shall be transferred to the books
of Seller as of the Closing Date. To the extent not funded in advance, Seller
shall promptly reimburse Buyer for the bonus amounts so paid (and the
employer\'s share of any payroll taxes associated therewith),
which reimbursement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with respect to the development and
distribution of any employee communications to be made to the Affected
Employees after the Closing Date relating to 2002 bonuses.   (f) Buyer,
Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all
Liabilities and obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and similar foreign, state and local rules, statutes and
ordinances resulting from the actions of Buyer, Panhandle or the Panhandle
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Buyer agrees to hold Seller harmless in
accordance with Article VIII for any breach of such responsibility and
Buyer\'s indemnification of Seller in this regard specifically includes
any Claim by the Affected Employees for back pay, front pay, benefits
or compensatory or punitive damages, any Claim by any Governmental Authority
for penalties regarding any issue of prior notification (or lack thereof) of
any plant closing or mass layoff occurring after the Closing Date and
Seller\'s costs, including reasonable attorney\'s fees, in defending any such
Claims.   (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.6,
Buyer shall cause all obligations of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company
pursuant to     52       existing collective bargaining agreements
(which agreements are listed in Section 3.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter)
to be honored following the Closing.   (h) Parent or its Affiliates shall
retain all assets that are accumulated through the Closing Date under
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (and deposited in various
VEBA accounts and 401(h) accounts of Parent or its Affiliates). Further,
Parent or its Affiliates shall retain the liability for PBOP for the benefit
of former Panhandle Employees who are retirees of Panhandle and/or the
Panhandle Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and Affected Employees who are
eligible to retire and qualified for benefits under PBOP as of the Closing
Date, and Parent or its Affiliates shall retain the responsibility for
providing post-retirement benefits (other than pension) to such employees
pursuant to the eligibility requirements of the Seller Plans. Seller shall
provide a list of retirees and Affected Employees who are eligible to retire
as of the Closing Date.   Section 5.7 Tax Covenants.   (a) Section
338(h)(10) Election.   (i) Seller and Buyer shall jointly make an  election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable  provision of
applicable state or local income tax law) with respect to  the purchase of
the Panhandle Shares by Buyer (and with respect to the  Panhandle
Subsidiaries for which such an election may be made) and  shall cooperate
with each other to take all actions necessary and  appropriate (including
filing such additional forms, returns, elections  schedules and other
documents as may be required) to effect and  preserve a timely election, in
accordance with the provisions of  Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1
(or any comparable  provisions of state or local tax law) (the
"Election").   (ii) In connection with the Election, Buyer and  Seller
shall mutually prepare a Form 8023 (or successor form) with any  attachments.
Buyer shall prepare a draft Form 8023 and provide such  draft Form 8023 to
Seller no later than ninety (90) days prior to the  due date of such Form
8023. If, within thirty (30) days of the receipt  of the draft Form 8023,
Seller notifies Buyer that it disagrees with  the draft Form 8023 and
provides Buyer with its proposed Form 8023 and  a written or oral explanation
of the reasons for its adjustment, then  Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
resolve their disagreement within the  twenty (20) days following Seller\'s
notification of Buyer of such  disagreement, otherwise, the draft Form 8023
shall become the final  Form 8023 (the "Final Form 8023"). If Seller and
Buyer are unable to  resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall be
submitted to a  mutually agreed upon nationally recognized independent
accounting firm,  whose expense shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer,
for  resolution within twenty (20) days of such submission. The Form 8023 
delivered by such accounting firm shall be    53        the Final
Form 8023. The Final Form 8023 shall be binding on Buyer,  Seller, and their
respective Affiliates. Buyer and Seller shall take no  position, and cause
their respective Affiliates to take no position,  inconsistent with the Final
Form 8023.   (iii) Buyer and Seller shall mutually prepare any  forms or
schedules similar to Form 8023 that are required for  provisions of state or
local law that are comparable to Treasury  Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1
in a manner similar to the above  procedure. In the event that the Final Form
8023 (or similar forms or  schedules required for provisions of state or
local law) is disputed by  any Taxing authority, the party receiving written
notice of the dispute  shall promptly notify the other party hereto
concerning such dispute.   (b) Tax Return Filings, Refunds, and
Credits.    (i) Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause  such
preparation and filing) with the appropriate Tax authorities all  Tax Returns
(including any Consolidated Income Tax Returns) with  respect to Panhandle
and the Panhandle Subsidiaries (and make all  elections with respect to such
Tax Returns) for Tax periods that end on  or before the Closing Date (the
"Seller Returns"), and will pay (or  cause to be paid) all Taxes due with
respect to the Seller Returns.   (ii) Buyer shall timely prepare and file
(or cause  such preparation and filing) with the appropriate Tax authorities
all  Tax Returns (the "Straddle Period Returns") with respect to Panhandle 
and the Panhandle Subsidiaries (and make all elections with respect to  such
Tax Returns) for all Tax periods ending after the Closing Date  that include
the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"). All Straddle  Period Returns shall
be prepared in accordance with past practice to  the extent consistent with
applicable law and Panhandle\'s and the  Panhandle Subsidiaries\' operations.
Buyer shall provide Seller with  copies of any Straddle Period Returns at
least forty-five (45) days  prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to
any extensions  thereto), accompanied by a statement (the "Straddle
Statement") setting  forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Pre-
Closing Taxes as  defined below. If Seller agrees with the Straddle Period
Return and  Straddle Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer (or Buyer shall pay
to  Seller, if appropriate) an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes as 
shown on the Straddle Statement not later than two (2) Business Days  before
the due date (including any extensions thereof) for payment of  Taxes with
respect to such Straddle Period Return. If, within fifteen  (15) days of the
receipt of the Straddle Period Return and Straddle  Statement, Seller
notifies Buyer that it disputes the manner of  preparation of the Straddle
Period Return or the amount calculated in  the Straddle Statement, and
provides Buyer its proposed form of  Straddle Period Return, a statement
setting forth and calculating in  reasonable detail the   
54         Pre-Closing taxes, and a written or oral explanation of the
reasons for  its adjustment, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve
their  disagreement within the five (5) days following Seller\'s
notification  or Buyer of such disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable
to  resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall be submitted to a 
mutually agreed upon nationally recognized independent accounting firm, 
whose expense shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller, for  resolution
within twenty (20) days of such submission. The decision of  such accounting
firm with respect to such dispute shall be binding upon  Buyer and Seller,
and Seller shall pay to Buyer (or Buyer shall pay to  Seller, if appropriate)
an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes as  decided by such accounting firm
not later than two (2) Business Days  before the due date (including any
extensions thereof) for payment of  Taxes with respect to such Straddle
Period Return. If for any reason  the parties\' dispute is not resolved as
provided in this paragraph  prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days
before the due date  (including any extensions thereof) for payment of Taxes
with respect to  such Straddle Period Return, Seller shall pay to Buyer (or
Buyer shall  pay to Seller, if appropriate) an amount equal to the amount
of  Pre-Closing Taxes not in dispute not later than two (2) Business Days 
before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for payment of  Taxes
with respect to such Straddle Period Return.   (iii) From and after the
Closing Date, Buyer and its  Affiliates (including Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries) will  not file any amended Tax Return, carryback
claim, or other adjustment  request with respect to Panhandle or the
Panhandle Subsidiaries for any  Tax period that includes or ends on or before
the Closing Date unless  Seller consents in writing; provided, however, that
Buyer and its  affiliates may carryback for its own account (without paying
any  resulting refund or credit to Seller) any loss attributable to a tax 
period ending after the Closing Date to a tax period ending on or  before the
Closing Date provided that Buyer and its Affiliates shall  indemnify and make
Seller whole for any detriment or cost incurred (or  to be incurred) by
Seller as a result of such carryback.   (iv) For purposes of this Agreement,
in the case of  any Taxes of Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries that are
payable  with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that  constitutes "Pre-Closing Taxes" shall be the excess of (A) (i) in the 
case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or 
receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or  assignment
or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property (real  or personal,
tangible or intangible) be deemed equal to the amount that  would be payable
if the Tax period ended at the close of business on  the Closing Date
(including without limitation all Taxes attributable  to any Election) and
(ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those  described in clause (i)) imposed
on a periodic basis with respect to  the business or assets of Panhandle or
the     55        Panhandle Subsidiaries, be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for  the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on  an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately  preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which  is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period 
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which  is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period over (B)  any
prepayment or advances of Taxes or any payments of estimated Taxes  with
respect to the Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the  preceding
sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item that  is calculated
on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of  the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis  determined by multiplying the
total amount of such item allocated to  the Straddle Period by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number  of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the  Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar  days in the entire Straddle Period. Pre-Closing Taxes
include any Taxes  attributable to a Person that is treated as a partnership
for federal  income tax purposes as if such Person allocated Tax items to
its  partners in a manner consistent with this Section 5.7 (b)(iv). In the 
case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth  or
long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be  allocated
under this Section 5.7 (b)(iv) shall be computed by reference  to the level
of such items at the close of business on the Closing  Date. The parties
hereto will, to the extent permitted by Applicable  Law, elect with the
relevant Tax authority to treat a portion of any  Straddle Period as a short
taxable period ending as of the close of  business on the Closing Date. For
purposes of this Agreement,  "Post-Closing Taxes" shall include any Taxes of
Panhandle or the  Panhandle Subsidiaries that are payable with respect to a
Straddle  Period, except for the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes 
Pre-Closing Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, the Texas corporate 
franchise tax determined based on the income or capital of any entity  for
the year during which the Closing Date occurs shall be considered  to be a
Tax due with respect to the Straddle Period.   (v) Seller and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate in  preparing and filing all Tax Returns with respect to
Panhandle or the  Panhandle Subsidiaries, including maintaining and making
available to  each other all records reasonably necessary in connection with
Taxes of  Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries and in resolving all
disputes  and audits with respect to all Tax periods relating to Taxes of 
Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries.   (vi) For a period of six (6)
years after the  Closing Date, Seller and its representatives shall have
reasonable  access to the books and records (including the right to make
extracts  thereof) of Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries to the extent
that  such books and     56        records relate to Taxes and to
the extent that such access may  reasonably be required by Seller in
connection with matters relating to  or affected by the operation of
Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries  prior to the Closing Date. Such
access shall be afforded by Buyer upon  receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours.  If Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of
such books and records prior  to the expiration of such six-year period,
Buyer shall, prior to such  disposition, give Seller a reasonable
opportunity, at Seller\'s expense,  to segregate and remove such books and
records as Seller may select.   (vii) If a Tax Indemnified Party receives a
refund  or credit or other reimbursement with respect to Taxes for which it 
would be indemnified under this Agreement, the Tax Indemnified Party  shall
pay over such refund or credit or other reimbursement to the Tax 
Indemnifying Party.   (viii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause Panhandle or 
the Panhandle Subsidiaries to not, make, amend or revoke any Tax  election if
such action would adversely affect any of Seller or its  Affiliates with
respect to any Tax period ending on or before the  Closing Date or for the
Pre-Closing Period or any Tax refund with  respect thereto unless Buyer and
its Affiliates indemnify and make  Seller whole for any detriment or cost
incurred (or to be incurred) by  Seller as a result of such action.   (ix)
For purposes of this Agreement a "Consolidated  Income Tax Return" is any
income Tax Return filed with respect to any  consolidated, combined,
affiliated or unified group provided for under  Section 1501 of the Code and
the Treasury regulations under Section  1502 of the Code, or any comparable
provisions of state or local law,  other than any income Tax Return that
includes only Panhandle or the  Panhandle Subsidiaries.   (c) Indemnity for
Taxes.   (i) Seller hereby agrees to indemnify Buyer and  its affiliates
against and hold them harmless from and against all  liability for (i) all

all Taxes incurred by reason  of any Election, (ii) Pre-Closing Taxes with
respect to any Straddle  Period, and (iii) all Taxes that are attributable to
Seller or any  member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
group of  which at least one of Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries (or
any  direct or indirect predecessor(s) of any of them) was a member at any 
time on or prior to the Closing Date and not after the Closing Date  that is
imposed under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any  similar provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law), (iv)      57       any Taxes
of Panhandle or any Panhandle Subsidiary incurred as a  transferee or a
successor relating to any full or partial Tax period  ending on or before the
Closing Date, (v) Seller\'s portion of Transfer  Taxes pursuant to Section
5.7(g), and (vi) any Damages arising out of,  resulting from, or incurred in
connection with any breach or inaccuracy  of any representation or warranty
set forth in Section 3.16; provided  that the determination of whether such a
breach or inaccuracy of  Section 3.16(c), Section 3.16(d) or Section 3.16(e)
occurred will be  made without the Material Adverse Effect qualifications
contained  therein.   (ii) Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify Seller and 
its Affiliates against and hold them harmless from all liability for  (A) all
Taxes of Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries with respect  to all Tax
periods beginning after the Closing Date, (B) Post-Closing  Taxes with
respect to any Straddle Period, and (C) Buyer\'s portion of  Transfer Taxes
pursuant to Section 5.7 (g).   (iii) The obligation of Seller to indemnify
and hold  harmless Buyer, on the one hand, and the obligations of Buyer to 
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, on the other hand, pursuant to this 
Section 5.7 shall terminate upon the expiration of the applicable  statutes
of limitations with respect to the Tax Liabilities in question  (giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) or if a  Claim is
brought with respect thereto, until such time as such Claim is  resolved.  
(d) Certain Payments. Buyer and Seller agree to treat (and cause their
Affiliates to treat) any payment by Seller under Section 5.7 (b)(ii) or
Section 5.7 (c) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes.   (e) Contests.   (i) After the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer each  shall notify the other party in writing within ten (10) days of
the  commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding 
affecting the Taxes of any of Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries  that,
if determined adversely to the taxpayer (the "Tax Indemnified  Party") or
after the lapse of time would be grounds for indemnification  under this
Section 5.7 by the other party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party"  and a "Tax
Claim"). Such notice shall contain factual information  describing any
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall  include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Tax  authority in respect of any
such asserted Tax liability. Failure to  give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided in  this Section 5.7 except to the extent
the Tax Indemnifying Party shall  have been prejudiced as a result of such
failure (except that the Tax  Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during  the period in which the Tax Indemnified Party
failed to give such  notice). Thereafter, the Tax Indemnified Party
shall    58        deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party, as
promptly as possible but in  no event later than ten (10) days after the Tax
Indemnified Party\'s  receipt thereof, copies of all relevant notices and
documents  (including court papers) received by the Tax Indemnified
Party.   (ii) In the case of an audit or administrative or  judicial
proceeding involving any asserted liability for Taxes relating  to any
Taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date,  Seller shall
have the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of  such audit or
proceeding; provided, however, that if Seller does not  timely take control
of such audit or proceeding, Buyer may, at its  expense, control the conduct
of the audit or proceeding. In the case of  an audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding involving any  asserted liability for Taxes relating to
any Straddle Period, Buyer  shall have the right, at its expense, to control
the conduct of such  audit or proceeding; provided, however, that (A) Buyer
shall keep  Seller reasonably informed with respect to the status of such
audit or  proceeding and provide Seller with copies of all written
correspondence  with respect to such audit or proceeding in a timely manner
and (B) if  such audit or proceeding would be reasonably expected to result
in a  material increase in Tax liability of Panhandle or the Panhandle 
Subsidiaries for which Seller would be liable under this Section 5.7  Seller
may participate in the conduct of such audit or proceeding at  its own
expense.   (iii) In the case of an audit or administrative or  judicial
proceeding involving any asserted liability for Taxes relating  to any
Taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer  shall have
the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such  audit or
proceeding.   (iv) Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in 
connection with any Tax Claim, and such cooperation shall include the 
provision to the Tax Indemnifying Party of records and information  which are
reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim and making employees  available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional  information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.   (f) Section 743 Determination.   (i)
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate  with each other with respect to
making any election under Section 754  of the Code for any Panhandle
Subsidiary or any Related Company. Prior  to making any adjustments pursuant
to Section 743 of the Code as a  result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement Buyer shall  prepare a schedule indicating such adjustments
that Buyer proposes to  make (the "743 Schedule") and provide such schedule
to Seller. If,  within ten (10) days of the receipt of the 743 Schedule,
Seller  notifies Buyer that it     59       disagrees with the 743
Schedule and provides Buyer with its proposed  743 Schedule and a written or
oral explanation of the reasons for the  adjustment, then Seller and Buyer
shall attempt to resolve their  disagreement within the twenty (20) days
following Buyer\'s notification  of Seller of such disagreement, otherwise,
the 743 Schedule shall be  deemed the final 743 Schedule (the "Final 743
Schedule"). If Seller and  Buyer are unable to resolve their disagreement,
the dispute shall be  submitted to a mutually agreed upon nationally
recognized independent  accounting firm, whose expense shall be borne equally
by Seller and  Buyer, for resolution within twenty (20) days of such
submission. The  743 Schedule delivered by such accounting firm shall be the
Final 743  Schedule. The Final 743 Schedule shall be binding on Buyer,
Seller, and  their respective Affiliates. Buyer and Seller shall take no
position,  and cause their respective Affiliates to take no position,
inconsistent  with the Final 743 Schedule.   (ii) Buyer and Seller shall
mutually prepare any  forms or schedules necessary to give effect to the
preceding paragraph.  In the event that any Tax position taken in reliance
upon the Final 743  Schedule is disputed by any Taxing authority, the party
receiving  written notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
party  hereto concerning such dispute.   (g) Transfer and Similar Taxes.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, all
sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller,
and Seller shall accurately file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes and timely pay all such Transfer
Taxes. If required by Applicable Law, Buyer will join in the execution of any
such Return. Seller shall provide copies of any Tax Returns with respect to
Transfer Taxes to Buyer no later than five (5) days after the due dates of
such Tax Returns.   (h) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. On or prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause all Tax sharing agreements between
Seller or any of its Affiliates (as determined immediately after the Closing
Date) on the one hand, and Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries on the
other hand, to be terminated, and all obligations thereunder shall be
settled, and no additional payments shall be made under any provisions
thereof after the Closing Date.   Section 5.8 Intercompany Accounts.  
Except as set forth on Section 5.8 of the Seller Disclosure Letter or as
contemplated by the Assumption Agreement, prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (other than Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries) to, settle intercompany accounts payable (including
any debt payable) to Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries and accounts
receivable (including any debt receivable) from Panhandle or the Panhandle
Subsidiaries. Seller shall determine the method by which    
60       such intercompany accounts are eliminated including, but not
limited to, by means of setoff, settlement, capital contribution or reduction
in capital.   Section 5.9 Related Agreements.   At the Closing or as
otherwise provided herein, (i) Southern Union and Buyer shall execute and
deliver to Seller duly executed copies of the Related Agreements to which
they are a party and (ii) Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller
Counterparties to, execute and deliver to Buyer duly executed copies of the
Related Agreements to which they are a party.   Section 5.10 Maintenance of
Insurance Policies.   (a) Seller and Buyer agree that Casualty Insurance
claims relating to the businesses of Panhandle and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries (including reported claims and including incurred but not
reported claims) will remain with Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries
immediately following the Closing. For purposes hereof, "Casualty Insurance
Claims" shall mean workers\' compensation, auto liability, general liability
and products liability claims and claims for damages caused to the facilities
of Panhandle or the Panhandle Subsidiaries generally insured under all risk,
real property, boiler and mechanical breakdown insurance coverage. The
Casualty Insurance Claims are subject to the provisions of the Insurance
Policies with insurance carriers and contractual arrangements with insurance
adjusters maintained by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing. With
respect to the Casualty Insurance Claims, the following procedures shall
apply: (i) Seller or its Affiliates shall continue to administer, adjust,
settle and pay, on behalf of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries, all
Casualty Insurance Claims with dates of occurrence prior to the date of
Closing; provided, that Seller will obtain the consent of Buyer prior to
adjusting, settling or paying any Casualty Insurance Claim of an amount
greater than $100,000 and provided, further, that Seller shall permit Buyer
to join Seller in any settlement negotiations with claimants, insurers,
or insurance adjusters; and (ii) Seller shall invoice Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries at the end of each month for Casualty Insurance Claims
paid on behalf of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries by Seller. Buyer
shall cause Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries to pay the invoice
within thirty (30) days of its date. In the event that Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries do not pay Seller within thirty (30) days of such
invoice, interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum shall accrue on
the amount of such invoice. Casualty Insurance Claims to be paid by Seller
hereunder shall include all costs necessary to settle claims including
compensatory, medical, legal and other allocated expenses, net of insurance
proceeds. In the event that any Casualty Insurance Claims exceeds a
deductible or self-insured retention under the Insurance Policies, Seller
shall be entitled to the benefit of any insurance proceeds that may be
available to discharge any portion of such Casualty Insurance Claim.   (b)
Other than as set forth in Section 3.21 hereof, Seller makes no
representation or warranty with respect to the applicability, validity or
adequacy of any Insurance Policies, and Seller shall not be responsible to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates for the failure of any insurer to pay under
any such Insurance Policy.     61    (c) Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to provide or shall be construed as providing a benefit or release
to any insurer or claims service organization of any obligation under any
Insurance Policies. Seller and Buyer confirm that the sole intention of this
Section 5.10 is to divide and allocate the benefits and obligations under the
Insurance Policies between them as of the Closing Date and not to effect,
enhance or diminish the rights and obligations of any insurer or claims
service organization thereunder. Nothing herein shall be construed as
creating or permitting any insurer or claims service organization the right
of subrogation against Seller or Buyer or any of their Affiliates in respect
of payments made by one to the other under any Insurance Policy.   (d) If
Buyer requests a copy of an Insurance Policy relating to a pending or
threatened Casualty Insurance Claim, Seller shall provide a copy of all
relevant insurance policies which insure such Casualty Insurance
Claims within five (5) Business Days, provided, that if Seller cannot provide
such policy within five (5) days after exercising reasonable best efforts to
locate such policy, Seller shall continue to exercise its reasonable best
efforts to provide such policy to Buyer as soon as possible thereafter.  
Section 5.11 Preservation of Records.   Buyer agrees that it shall, at its
own expense, preserve and keep the records held by it relating to the
respective businesses of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries that could
reasonably be required after the Closing by Seller for as long as may be
required for such categories of records for the greater of the time periods
required pursuant to the Access and Support Agreement and the time periods
required pursuant to the applicable document retention program in effect on
the Closing Date (a copy of which has been provided to Buyer). In addition,
Buyer shall make such records available to Seller as may reasonably be
required by Seller in connection with, among other things, any insurance
claim, legal proceeding or governmental investigation relating to the
respective businesses of Seller and its Affiliates, including Panhandle and
the Panhandle Subsidiaries.   Section 5.12 Public Statements.   On or
prior to the Closing Date, neither party shall, nor shall permit its
Affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other party hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any such press release or
announcement is required by law, court process or stock exchange rule to be
made by the party proposing to issue the same, such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party prior
to the issuance of any such press release or announcement.   Section 5.13
Certain Transactions.   Buyer and Southern Union shall not, and shall not
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to acquire or agree to acquire by
merging or consolidating with, or by      62    purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire
any assets if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of,
or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) significantly increase the risk of not being able to remove
any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to
Closing, Southern Union shall not, and the Subsidiaries of Southern Union
shall not, acquire or agree to acquire any ownership interest in Southern
Star Central or any material asset of Southern Star Central.   Section 5.14
CMS Panhandle Holdings, LLC.   Buyer covenants to maintain CMS Panhandle
Holdings, LLC as a partnership for all Tax purposes through December 31,
2003.   Section 5.15 Change of Corporate Name.   As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date (the "Corporate Name Change Transition
Period"), Buyer shall cause each of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to change its corporate name to a name that does not include
"CMS" and to make any necessary legal filings with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities to effectuate such changes. Buyer shall hold
harmless and indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties (as defined herein) against
all costs, expenses and Damages to the extent incurred by Seller Indemnified
Parties resulting from or arising in connection with Buyer\'s, Panhandle\'s
or any Panhandle Subsidiary\'s use of the "CMS" name during the Corporate
Name Change Transition Period.   Section 5.16 Transitional Use of Seller\'s
Trademarks.   (a) Seller hereby grants to Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries, effective upon the Closing Date, a limited non-
transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free transitional right and license to
use the trademarks, service marks, and trade names listed on Section 5.16 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, together with all slogans, logotypes, designs
and trade dress associated therewith which are, in each case, in existence at
Closing Date and currently being used in the conduct of the businesses of
Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Seller\'s
Marks") solely on and in connection with the goods and services of the
businesses of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries and which are embodied
in or on any stationery, business cards, advertising and promotional
materials, packaging and labels, equipment, manuals and     
63      other documentation, statements of work, trucks, hard hats,
e-mail addresses, caller ID, printed facsimile headers and footers, web page
content and URLs for web sites, Messenger screens, signs on facilities owned
or leased by Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries, and inventory
("Business Materials"), and for any administrative, corporate and legal use
in connection with the transition away from using the Seller\'s Marks (the
"Transitional License").   (b) Panhandle\'s and the Panhandle Subsidiaries\'
right to use the Seller\'s Marks shall automatically cease as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than
six (6) months following the Closing Date. Upon the termination of
Panhandle\'s and the Panhandle Subsidiaries\' right to use Seller\'s Marks,
Panhandle and each Panhandle Subsidiary shall immediately cease all use of
Seller\'s Marks and all materials bearing Seller\'s Marks (such materials to
be returned to Seller or destroyed).   (c) All rights and goodwill arising
from the use of Seller\'s Marks and/or any similar names or marks (including
logos) shall inure solely to Seller\'s benefit. Panhandle and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries agree that neither Buyer, Panhandle nor any Panhandle Subsidiary
shall use, directly or indirectly, the word "CMS" or any marks similar
thereto, as part of Buyer\'s, Panhandle\'s or any Panhandle Subsidiary\'s own
trade names, or in any other way that suggests that there is any relation or
affiliation between Seller and Buyer, or Seller and Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries, other than that created by this Agreement, or as a
trademark, service mark or trade name for any other business, product or
service. Panhandle and Panhandle Subsidiaries shall have no interest in
Seller\'s Marks except as expressly provided in this Agreement and shall
not claim any other rights therein. Nothing in this Agreement or in the
performance thereof, or that might otherwise be implied by law, shall operate
to grant Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries any right, title, or
interest in or to Seller\'s Marks other than as specified in the limited
license grant in this Agreement. All rights not expressly granted in this
Agreement or herein are reserved to Seller.   (d) Panhandle and the
Panhandle Subsidiaries agree to assign to Seller and do hereby assign to
Seller all rights they may acquire, if any, by operation of law or otherwise
in Seller\'s Marks, including all applications or registrations therefore,
along with the goodwill associated therewith. Panhandle and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries shall assist Seller in protecting and maintaining Seller\'s
rights in Seller\'s Marks in connection with Panhandle\'s and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries\' licensed use hereunder, including preparation and execution of
documents necessary or appropriate in the ordinary course to register
Seller\'s Marks and/or record this Agreement. As between the parties, Seller
shall have the sole right to, and in its sole discretion may,
commence, prosecute or defend, and control any action concerning Seller\'s
Marks.   (e) During the term of the Transitional License, Buyer, Panhandle
and the Panhandle Subsidiaries shall not take, or agree or commit to take,
any action that would or would be reasonably likely have an adverse impact on
any of the Seller\'s Marks.     64       (f) Neither Buyer,
Panhandle, nor any Panhandle Subsidiary shall directly or indirectly, contest
the validity of, by act or omission jeopardize, or take any action
inconsistent with, Seller\'s rights in Seller\'s Marks (including attempting
to register Seller\'s Marks or a mark incorporating either Seller\'s Marks or
the word "CMS" or any mark similar thereto). Panhandle\'s and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries\' rights under the license granted herein are personal and may
not be sublicensed, assigned or otherwise transferred.   Section 5.17
Reasonable Best Efforts.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use all reasonable best

law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner
practicable the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 5.18 No
Shopping.   From and after the Original Date hereof, none of Seller,
Panhandle, the Panhandle Subsidiaries nor their officers, directors,
employees, affiliates, stockholders, representatives, agents, nor anyone
acting on behalf of them shall, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit,
engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-public
information to, any Person (other than Buyer, Southern Union or their
respective representatives) concerning any merger, sale of assets, purchase
or sale of Panhandle Shares or similar transaction involving Panhandle or the
Panhandle Subsidiaries (collectively, "Prohibited Transactions") unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Article VII
hereof; provided however, that nothing herein shall prohibit a transaction
resulting in a change of control of any direct or indirect parent of
Panhandle.   Section 5.19 Southern Union Covenants.   Southern Union shall
cause Buyer to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement which are
required to be performed on and prior to the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, Buyer\'s requirement to consummate the transaction in accordance
with and subject to the terms of Section 2.2 hereof and to pay the Purchase
Price in accordance with Article II.   Section 5.20 Restated Financials.  
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver the
Restated Financials to Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement. Seller shall instruct Ernst and Young LLP to conduct an
audit of the financial statements of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 as soon as reasonably practicable
after Panhandle management completes such financial statements, Seller shall
cooperate with such audit, and shall deliver to Buyer a copy of the audited
financial statements of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and Ernst and Young LLP\'s audit opinion

reasonably requires audited or reviewed financial statements with respect to
Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries in order to comply with the
reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission set forth in
Regulations S-K and S-X, Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer (at
Buyer\'s cost), including any reasonable request that Seller instruct Ernst and
Young LLP to prepare and deliver to Buyer a comfort letter, customary
in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered in similar
circumstances.   Section 5.21 1935 Act Jurisdiction.   Neither Southern
Union and its Affiliates nor Seller and its Affiliates shall take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to require
any filing, approval or consent under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended.   Section 5.22 Registration of Southern Union
Shares.   (a) Prior to Closing, Southern Union shall prepare and file with
the SEC a prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the
Shelf Registration Statement to effect the registration of the Southern Union
Shares. Southern Union shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Shelf Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate
the sale of the Southern Union Shares by Seller. Seller and its Affiliates
shall cooperate with Southern Union in timely obtaining any consents,
approvals, or waivers or making any filings, or furnishing information
required in connection with the Prospectus Supplement.   (b) Southern Union
will advise Seller, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the
Southern Union Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction.   ARTICLE

respective obligations of each party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions at or prior to the
Closing Date:   (a) Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

obtained prior to Closing by Seller, Southern Union or by Buyer from, any
Governmental Authority under any law in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been made or obtained (as the case
may be), except where the failure for such waiting periods to expire or to be
terminated, to make such filings, or to obtain any such authorizations,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, if any consent, approval or authorization from any
Governmental Authority the absence of which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect is not obtained prior to or at the Closing and, as a result, the
transfer of one or more assets, rights or interests is prevented at the
Closing, from and after the Closing, Seller, Southern Union and Buyer shall
continue to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such requisite
consent, approval or authorization. If the parties are unable to obtain the
necessary approvals and, as a result, such assets, rights or interests may
not be transferred to Buyer within 90 days after the Closing, the parties
shall mutually agree on an acceptable adjustment to the Purchase Price to
reflect the fair market value of such assets, rights or interests as of
the Closing Date; and   (c) No court of competent jurisdiction or other
competent Governmental Authority shall have issued a statute, rule,

Panhandle Shares or the ownership or operation by Buyer of a material portion
of the business or assets of Panhandle and the Panhandle Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.   Section 6.2 Buyer\'s Conditions to the Closing.   The

or "Material Adverse Effect," shall be true and correct at and as of the

for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001
(including the opinion of Ernst and Young LLP with respect thereto) (the
"Annual Financial Statements") and the restated unaudited financial
statements of Panhandle for the quarters ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002

Restated Financials (and draft notes thereto) delivered to Buyer prior to the

such footnotes in the Interim Financial Statements, except for corresponding
changes reflected in the Annual Financial Statements; and   (j) Seller
shall have caused Panhandle to cure any defaults (currently under waiver by

of the Seller Disclosure Letter relating to a failure to furnish such lenders
with certified financial statements.     68       Section 6.3

Southern Union contained in this Agreement (A) if subject to any limitations
as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect," shall be true and correct

not subject to any limitations as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse
Effect," shall be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date as if made
at and as of such time except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Buyer and Southern Union to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;   (b) Buyer and Southern Union shall have
made all deliveries required under Section 2.7;   (c) Each of Buyer and
Southern Union shall have performed in all material respects all of its
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior

issuance and delivery of the Southern Union Shares, their registration
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and the Listing shall have
expired or been terminated, and all filings required by law to be made prior
to Closing by Southern Union with, and all consents, approvals
and authorizations required by law to be obtained prior to Closing by
Southern Union from, any Governmental Authority under any law in connection
with the issuance and delivery of the Southern Union Shares, their
registration pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and the Listing
shall have been made or obtained (as the case may be).     69      
ARTICLE VII   TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT   Section 7.1 Termination.  
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing
Date by:   (a) mutual written consent of the parties;   (b) by either
Buyer or Seller, upon written notice to the other parties, if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before June 30, 2003 (the "Initial Termination
Date"); provided, however, that if on the Initial Termination Date the
conditions to closing set forth in Section 6.1 (a), Section 6.1 (b) and
Section 6.1 (c) shall have been fulfilled and certain other conditions set
forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 shall not have been
fulfilled but are reasonably capable of being fulfilled no later than
ten business days after the Initial Termination Date, then, if a written
notice requesting an extension of the termination date has been delivered by
either Buyer to Seller, or by Seller to Buyer, at any time during the ten
business day period ending on the Initial Termination Date, the termination
date shall be extended to July 15, 2003.   (c) by either Buyer or Seller
upon written notice to the other party, if any of the mutual conditions to
the Closing set forth in Section 6.1 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment by June 30, 2003 or July 15, 2003, as the case may be, and shall
not have been waived in writing by the other party;   (d) by Buyer, so long
as Buyer is not then in breach of its obligations under this Agreement, upon
a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Seller shall have been or
become untrue, in each case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2
would not be satisfied; provided, however, that Buyer may not terminate this
Agreement if such breach or untruth is capable of being cured by Seller by
not later than June 30, 2003 or July 15, 2003, as the case may be, through
the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, so long as Seller continues to
exercise such reasonable best efforts (until not later than June 30, 2003 or
July 15, 2003, as the case may be);   (e) by Seller, so long as Seller is
not then in breach of its obligations under this Agreement, upon a breach of
any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer or Southern Union set forth in
this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Buyer and Southern
Union shall have been or become untrue, in each case such that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.3 would not be satisfied; provided, however, that
Seller may not terminate this Agreement if such breach or untruth is capable
of being cured by Buyer and Southern Union by not later than July 15, 2003,
through the exercise of their reasonable best efforts, so long as Buyer and
Southern Union continue to exercise such reasonable best efforts (until not
later than June 30, 2003 or July 15, 2003, as the case may be); and   
70       (f) by either Seller or Buyer if any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action, which permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which order, decree, ruling
or other action is not subject to appeal; unless failure to consummate
closing because of such action by the Governmental Authority is due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate to have fulfilled its obligations
under Section 5.4 and Section 5.5.   Section 7.2 Procedure and Effect of
Termination.   In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 (i) this Agreement, except for the provisions of Section 5.2 (b),
all of Article IX and this Section 7.2 , shall become void and have no
effect, without any Liability on the part of any party hereto or its
directors, officers, stockholders or partners; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 7.2 shall relieve any party for liability for any
breach of this Agreement as set forth in the next succeeding sentence of this
Section 7.2 and (ii) all filings, applications and other submissions made
pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn
from the agency or other Person to which they were made or appropriately
amended to reflect the termination of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in this Section 7.2 shall relieve
any party hereto of liability for Damages resulting from any breach of any of
its obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that for purposes of
this clause (a), Damages shall be deemed not to include Third Party Claims,
and (b) if it shall be judicially determined that termination of this
Agreement was caused by an intentional breach of this Agreement, then, in
addition to other remedies at law or equity for breach of this Agreement, but
subject to the limitation in clause (a) above, the party so found to have
intentionally breached this Agreement shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other party hereto for its respective out-of-pocket costs, including the fees
and expenses of their counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other
experts and advisors, as well as fees and expenses incident to the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and
related documentation.   ARTICLE VIII   SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION  
Section 8.1 Survival.   (a) The representations and warranties provided for
in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and
effect until the twelve-month (12) anniversary of this Agreement; provided
however, that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2
(Authority Relative to this Agreement), Section 3.3 (Panhandle Shares),
Section 3.19 (Brokerage and Finders\' Fees), Section 4.2 (Authority Relative
to this Agreement), Section 4.7 (Brokerage and Finders\' Fees) and Section
4.11 (Southern Union Shares) shall survive indefinitely, the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.16 (Tax Matters) shall survive for a
period equal to the applicable statute of limitations for each Tax and
taxable year, and the representations and     71      warranties set
forth in Section 3.15 (Environmental; Health and Safety Matters) shall
survive until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date.   (b) No
Claim for damages or other relief of any kind (including a Claim for
indemnification under Section 8.2 hereof) arising against an Indemnified
Party out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether sounding in contract, tort, breach of warranty, securities
law, other statutory cause of action, deceptive trade practice, strict
liability, product liability or other cause of action or theory of liability
(except, in all cases Claims alleging fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
intentional misconduct), may be brought unless suit thereon is filed, or a
written notice describing the nature of that Claim, the theory of liability,
the nature of the relief sought and the material factual assertions upon
which the Claim is based is given to the other party, before the termination
of the Survival Period.   (c) The survival period of each representation or
warranty as provided in this Section 8.1 is referred to herein as the
"Survival Period." Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation or
warranty that would otherwise terminate shall survive with respect to Damages
which respect to which suit thereon is filed or of which notice describing
the nature of that Claim, the theory of liability, the nature of the relief
sought and the material factual assertions upon which the Claim is based is
given pursuant to this Agreement prior to the end of the Survival Period,
until the matter is finally resolved and any related Damages are paid.  
Section 8.2 Indemnification.   (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article VIII, subsequent to the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend,
save and hold harmless, Buyer, Southern Union, Panhandle and the Panhandle
Subsidiaries, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and their
shareholders, members, partners (general and limited), officers, directors,
managers, trustees, incorporators, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants
and representatives, and each of their heirs, executors, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), against and in
respect of any and all Damages to the extent incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection
with:   (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or  warranty of
Seller contained in this Agreement;   (ii) any breach by Seller of any
covenant or  agreement contained in this Agreement; and   (iii) the matters
set forth on Section 8.2 (a)(iii)  of the Seller Disclosure Letter.   (b)
Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, subsequent to the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless, Seller and
its Affiliates, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and their
shareholders, members, partners (general and limited), officers, directors,
managers,      72      trustees, incorporators, employees, agents,
attorneys, consultants and representatives, and each of their heirs,
executors, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") against and in respect of any and all Damages to the extent
incurred by the Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or
incurred in connection with:   (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or  warranty of Buyer or Southern Union contained in this
Agreement; and   (ii) any breach by Buyer or Southern Union of any 
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.   (c) Any Person
providing indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.2 is
referred to herein as an "Indemnifying Party," and any Person entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.2 is referred to
herein as an "Indemnified Party."   (d) Seller\'s indemnification
obligations contained in Section 8.2 (a)(i) shall not apply to any Claim for
Damages until the aggregate of all such Damages total $40,000,000 (the
"Threshold Amount"), in which event Seller\'s indemnity obligation contained
in Section 8.2 (a)(i) shall apply to all Claims for Damages in excess of the
Threshold Amount, subject to a maximum liability to all Indemnified Parties,
in the aggregate, of $200,000,000 (the "Cap Amount") for all Claims under
Section 8.2 (a)(i) in the aggregate. Damages relating to any single breach or
series of related breaches of Seller\'s representations and warranties shall
not constitute Damages, and therefore shall not be applied towards the
Threshold Amount or be indemnifiable hereunder, unless such Damages relating
to any single breach or series of related breaches exceed $1,000,000 (the
"Minimum Claim Amount").   (e) Buyer\'s indemnification obligations
contained in Section 8.2 (b)(i) shall not apply to any Claim for Damages
until the aggregate of all such Damages equals the Threshold Amount, in which
event Buyer\'s indemnification obligation contained in Section 8.2 (b)(i)
shall apply to all Claims for Damages in excess of the Threshold Amount,
subject to a maximum liability to all Indemnified Parties, in the aggregate,
of the Cap Amount for all Claims under Section 8.2 (b)(i) in the aggregate.
Damages relating to any single breach or series of related breaches of
Buyer\'s and Southern Union\'s representations and warranties shall not
constitute Damages, and therefore shall not be applied towards the Threshold
Amount or be indemnifiable hereunder, unless such Damages relating to any
single breach or series of related breaches exceed the Minimum Claim
Amount.   (f) The indemnification obligations of each party hereto
under this Section 8.2 shall inure to the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties, and such Buyer Indemnified Parties
and Seller Indemnified Parties will be obligated to keep and perform the
obligations imposed on an Indemnified Party by this Section 8.2, on the same
terms as are applicable to such other party.      73      (g) In
all cases in which a Person is entitled to be indemnified in accordance with
this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall be under a duty to take all
commercially reasonable measures to mitigate all losses. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
collect any amount available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages for which an indemnity
claim is being made; provided, that the reasonable costs incurred by the
Indemnified Party in taking such measures shall be included in the amount of
any Claim.   (h) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under
this Agreement to multiple recovery for the same losses. If an Indemnified
Party receives any amount under applicable insurance policies, or from any
other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing
such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified
Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting
such amount.   (i) All amounts paid by Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be, under this Article VIII shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes.   (j) Notwithstanding any other provision in
the Agreement to the contrary, this Section 8.2 shall not apply to any Claim
of indemnification with respect to Tax matters. Claims for indemnification
with respect to Tax matters shall be governed by Section 5.7.   (k) For
purposes of this Article VIII only, the existence of a breach of a
representation or warranty in this Agreement and the calculation of Damages
arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement
shall be determined without giving effect to any exception or qualification
of such representation or warranty as to the materiality of the breach
thereof or the Material Adverse Effect on any Person of such breach.  Except
as provided in Section 5.7 hereof, the provisions of this Article VIII shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for Damages
arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with any inaccuracy
in any representation or the breach of any warranty made by Buyer or Southern
Union, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, in this Agreement;
provided, however, that this exclusive remedy for Damages does not preclude a
party from bringing an Action for specific performance or other equitable
remedy to require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any Related Agreement; provided, further, that this exclusive remedy for
Damages does not preclude a party from bringing an Action alleging fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or intentional misconduct without reference to
the provisions of this Article VIII.     74      Section 8.3
Calculation of Damages.   The Damages suffered by any Party hereto shall be
calculated after giving effect to the actual receipt of any available
insurance proceeds paid directly to the Indemnified Party. In computing the
amount of any insurance proceeds, such insurance proceeds shall be reduced by
a reasonable estimate of the present value of future premium increases
attributable to the payment of such Claim.   Section 8.4 Procedures for
Third-Party Claims.   (a) In the case of any Claim for indemnification
arising from a Claim of a third party against an Indemnified Party arising
under paragraph 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) as the case may be (a "Third-Party Claim"),
an Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying
Party of any Claim or demand of which such Indemnified Party has knowledge,
and as to which it may request indemnification hereunder, specifying (to the
extent known) the amount of such Claim and any relevant facts and
circumstances relating thereto; provided, however, that any failure to give
such prompt notice or to provide any such facts and circumstances will not
waive any rights of the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the
rights of the Indemnifying Party are actually materially prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right (and, if it elects to exercise
such right, to do so by written notice within thirty (30) days after
receiving notice from the Indemnified Party) to defend and to direct the
defense against any such Third-Party Claim, in its name or in the name of the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, and with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall not have taken any action to defend such Third-Party Claim within such
thirty-day (30-day) period, or (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
have reasonably concluded that there is a conflict of interest between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of the
defense of such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary (other than the last sentence of this Section 8.4 (a)), the
Indemnified Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (which shall
include only reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred), shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and keep the Indemnifying Party fully
informed in the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim
with counsel employed at its own expense; provided, however, that in the case
of any Third-Party Claim (A) described in clause (ii) above, or (B) as to
which the Indemnifying Party shall not in fact have employed counsel to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim within such thirty-day (30-day)
period, or (C) that involves assertion of criminal liability on the
Indemnified Party, or (D) seeks to force the Indemnified Party to take (or
prevent the Indemnified Party from taking) any action, then in each such case
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
conduct and control the defense thereof for the account of, and at the risk
of, the Indemnifying Party, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of such
Indemnified Party\'s counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party. Except as provided in the last sentence of Section 8.4 (b), the
Indemnifying Party shall have no indemnification obligations with respect
to any Third-Party Claim which shall be     75       settled by
the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.   (b) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense
of any Third Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to
a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-
Party Claim without the Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless
(i) such settlement or judgment relates solely to monetary damages, and (ii)
prior to consenting to such settlement or such entry of judgment, the
Indemnifying Party delivers to the Indemnified Party a writing (in form
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) which unconditionally
provides that, subject to the provisions of Section 8.2 (d) or Section 8.2
(e), as appropriate, relating to the Minimum Claim Amount, the Threshold
Amount and the Cap Amount, the Damages represented thereby are the
responsibility of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and that, subject to the provisions of the Threshold Amount, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all Damages associated therewith in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent, enter into any compromise or
settlement that (x) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear
to take, any action or (y) involves a reasonable likelihood of an imposition
of criminal liability on the Indemnified Party, or (z) does not provide for
a complete release by such third party of the Indemnified Party. With the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Indemnified Party shall
have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such
terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such
Third-Party Claim involves equitable or other nonmonetary relief against the
Indemnified Party or involves a reasonable likelihood of an imposition of
criminal liability on the Indemnified Party, and shall have the right to
settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages for which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this Section
8.4.   Section 8.5 Procedures for Inter-Party Claims.   In the event that
an Indemnified Party determines that it has a Claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third-Party Claim),
the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party, specifying the amount of such Claim and any relevant
facts and circumstances relating thereto, and such notice shall be promptly
given even if the nature or extent of the Damages is not then known. The
notification shall be subsequently supplemented within a reasonable time
as additional information regarding the Claim or the nature or extent of
Damages resulting therefrom becomes available to the Indemnified Party. Any
failure to give such prompt notice or supplement thereto or to provide any
such facts and circumstances will not waive any rights of the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the rights of the Indemnifying Party are
actually materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith for a thirty-day (30-day)
period regarding the resolution of any disputed Claims for Damages. Promptly
following the final determination of the amount of any Damages claimed by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations of the
Minimum     76       Claim Amount, Threshold Amount and the Cap
Amount, shall pay such Damages to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer or
check made payable to the order of the Indemnified Party.    ARTICLE
