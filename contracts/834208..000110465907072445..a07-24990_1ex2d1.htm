factors that the Board determines to be appropriate, is reasonably capable of
being consummated and would, if consummated in accordance with its terms,
result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the
Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the
Merger or this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.04). For purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal," each reference to 20% in the definition of
"Competing Transaction" shall be replaced with "more than 50%."

  



        
   

  



  

" _Taxes_ " shall mean any and all taxes, fees, levies, duties, tariffs,
imposts and other similar charges of any kind (together with any and all
interest, penalties, additions to tax and additional amounts imposed with
respect thereto) imposed by any Governmental Authority or taxing authority,
including: taxes or other charges on or with respect to income, franchise,
windfall or other profits, gross receipts, property, sales, use, capital
stock, payroll, employment, social security, workers
compensation, unemployment compensation or net worth; taxes or other charges
in the nature of excise, withholding, ad valorem, stamp, transfer, value-
added or gains taxes; license, registration and documentation fees; and
customers duties, tariffs and similar charges.

  



  

" _Tax Return_ " shall mean any return, declaration, report, statement,
information statement or other document filed or required to be filed by any
person, or with respect to such person or required to include such person,
with respect to Taxes, including any claims for refunds of Taxes, any
information returns and any amendments or supplements of any of the
foregoing.

SECTION 2.03 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date,
the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is

shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

SECTION 2.04 _Effect of the Merger_. As a result of the Merger, following the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

SECTION 2.05 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") until
thereafter amended as provided by Law and such Certificate of Incorporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, at the Effective Time, Article I of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to

### 

  

### (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at

prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, and the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to

or removal. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to obtain any resignations of its directors in their capacities as
such, and not in their capacities as employees (if applicable), necessary to
give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.06.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  

# _MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF SHARES_

  



  

SECTION 3.01 _Exchange of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  



  

### (a) _Capital Stock of Purchaser_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Capital Stock of the Company_. Subject to the other provisions of
Article III, each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per
share (each, a " _Share_ ", and collectively, the " _Shares_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)) shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive seventy eight dollars ($78.00) in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such Shares,
when so converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist. Each holder of a certificate or book-entry
share formerly representing any such converted Shares (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Warrants of the Company_. Each warrant to acquire Shares that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, upon
exercise thereof in accordance with its terms, entitle the holder thereof to
receive solely the Merger Consideration with respect to each Share
issuable upon the exercise of such warrant.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Treasury Shares_. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and
each Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without
any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with
respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc_. In the event of any change in the
number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares (including Options), issued and outstanding between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time by

  



        
   

  



  

### reason of any stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or
distribution, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
combination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration to be paid for each Share as provided
in this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted to effect such change and, as
so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such event be the Merger
Consideration.

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.02 _Options; Performance Shares; Restricted Shares_.

  



  

### (a) _Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all necessary action, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the consent of the individual option holders, if necessary, to cancel, at the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (each, an "
_Option_ ") granted under the equity based compensation plans listed in
Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "),
or otherwise that is outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested or
exercisable, as of such date. Each holder of an Option that is outstanding
and unexercised at the Effective Time and who has, if necessary, consented to
the cancellation of such holders Options, shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be entitled to be paid by the Surviving Corporation, with
respect to each Share subject to the Option, an amount in cash equal to the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per Share
exercise price of such Option, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local
Tax or social insurance Law with respect to the making of such payment.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Performance Share Units_. Effective as of the Effective Time, except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each then outstanding performance-
based restricted share unit granted by the Company based on Shares (a "
_Performance Share Unit_ "), for which achievement against the applicable
performance criteria will not have been evaluated and applied prior to the
Effective Time by the Company in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Company Equity Plan as in effect on the date hereof to determine the actual
number of restricted share units granted, shall be converted automatically
into Performance Share Units with respect to a number of Nokia Shares (and
otherwise subject to the terms of the Company Equity Plans, and the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder) equal to the product of (A) one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the number of Shares subject to the original
Performance Share Units that were granted (or, for performance-based
restricted share units where the original Performance Share Units were
granted at the maximum number of Performance Share Units that could be
granted at the highest performance level, seventy five percent (75%) of the
number of Shares subject to the original Performance Share Units that were
granted) and (B) multiplied by the ratio of the value of the per share Merger
Consideration to the value of the closing price for a Nokia Share on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time (such ratio, the "
_Equity Exchange Ratio_ "), _provided_ that any fractional Nokia
Shares resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded up to the nearest
whole share.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Restricted Share Units_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
then outstanding time-based restricted share unit granted by the Company
based on Shares and each then outstanding Performance Share Unit for which
the achievement against the applicable performance criteria had already
been evaluated and applied prior to the Effective Time by the Company in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Company Equity Plan as in effect on
the date hereof to determine the actual number of restricted share units that
comprise each such

  



        
   

  



  

### Performance Share Unit (each, a " _Restricted Share Unit_ ") shall be
converted automatically into Restricted Share Units with respect to a number
of Nokia Shares (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Company Equity
Plans, and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder) equal to the product
of the number of Shares subject to the Restricted Share Units and the Equity
Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional Nokia Shares resulting from
such multiplication shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Company Approvals_. The Company shall take all necessary action to
approve the disposition of the Options, Performance Share Units and
Restricted Share Units in connection with the Merger to the extent necessary
to exempt such dispositions and acquisitions under Rule 16b-3 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ").

  

### 

  

### (e) _Nokia Actions_. Nokia shall take all action reasonably necessary or
appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number
Nokia Shares for delivery upon settlement of the Performance Share Units and
the Restricted Share Units. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Nokia shall prepare and file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a registration statement on Form
S-8 registering a number of Nokia Shares necessary to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 3.02.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Performance Share and Restricted Share Unit Cashout_. Notwithstanding
anything in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.02(c) to the contrary, in the
event that Parent, in its sole discretion, determines that it is not in the
best interests of the Company, Parent or a holder of a Performance Share Unit
or Restricted Share Unit, to have either Parent or Nokia assume a Performance
Share Unit or Restricted Share Unit, then Parent shall, no later than 30 days
prior to the Effective Time, determine that such Performance Share Unit or
Restricted Share Unit shall, at the Effective Time, immediately lapse and be
free of any forfeiture restrictions whatsoever and be converted into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration for each underlying Share, less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of U.S. state or local Tax or social insurance law with respect to
the making of such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 3.02(f), Parent or Nokia shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to effectuate any conversion of Performance Share Unit
**s** in a manner that will not give rise to adverse tax consequences or
penalties to the holders thereof under Section 409A of the Code.

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.03 _Dissenting Shares_. (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither
voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall
have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares and otherwise
complied in all other respects with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
otherwise waived, withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares
under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon

  



        
   

  



  

surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.04, of the certificate or
certificates or transfer of the uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced
such Shares.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

SECTION 3.04 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.
(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to
receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant
to Sections 3.01(b), 3.02(a) and, if applicable, 3.02(f). Prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares and Options, for payment in
accordance with this Article III through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount
sufficient to permit payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Sections 3.01(b), 3.02(a) and, if applicable, 3.02(f) (the "
_Payment Fund_ "). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any interest or other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If for any
reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts
to which holders of Shares and Company Equity Awards shall be entitled under
Sections 3.01, 3.02(a) and, if applicable, 3.02(f), Parent shall take all
steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments
required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges
and expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of Shares
for the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.01(b) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or transfer of the uncertificated Shares (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ ") to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or the Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Each holder of Shares shall be
entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal or (ii) receipt of
an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration, without
interest, payable for each Share represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration as provided for herein.

  



        
   

  



  

##### (i) If the payment equal to the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered on the stock transfer books of
the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and
(ii) the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) If any holder of Shares is unable to surrender such holders
Certificates because such Certificates have been lost, mutilated or
destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit and indemnity
bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation.

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Shares such amount
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ ") or any Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  

##### 

  

### (c) At any time following the sixth month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration
that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws.

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.05 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day of
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Law.

and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

  



  

SECTION 4.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. (a) Each of the

on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company and each Subsidiary
is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under the Agreement, or would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (b) A true and complete list of all Subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary, the percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary owned by the Company and each
other Subsidiary, and the names of the directors and officers of each

(collectively, the " _Company Governing Documents_ ") or equivalent

Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of Company
Governing Documents or equivalent organizational documents.

  



  

SECTION 4.03 _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of four-hundred million (400,000,000) Shares and ten million

the date of this Agreement, no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued
and outstanding. Except as set forth in this Section 4.03 above, as of the
date hereof, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any

  



        
   

  



  

Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary.

  



  

### (b) Section 4.03 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following
information with respect to each Company Stock Award outstanding on the date
of this Agreement: (i) the name and address of the Company Equity Award
recipient; (ii) the particular plan pursuant to which such Company Equity
Award was granted; (iii) the number of Shares subject to such Company Equity
Award; (iv) the exercise or purchase price of such Company Equity Award; (v)
the date on which such Company Equity Award was granted; (vi) the applicable
vesting schedule; and (vii) the date on which such Company Equity Award

exhibits to reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act with the SEC
accurate and complete copies of all Company Equity Plans pursuant to which
the Company has granted the Company Equity Awards that are currently
outstanding and the form of all award agreements evidencing such Performance
Share Units or Restricted Share Units. All Shares subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or any capital stock of any Subsidiary
or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary or any other person.
Since January 1, 2003, all outstanding Shares, all outstanding Options and
all outstanding shares of capital stock of each subsidiary have been issued
and granted in compliance with (i) applicable U.S. federal securities Laws
and other applicable U.S. state blue sky Laws and (ii) all requirements set
forth in applicable contracts.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and each such share
is owned by the Company or another subsidiary free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on the Companys or any subsidiarys voting rights,
charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

  

### 

  

SECTION 4.04 _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Shares, if and to the
extent required by applicable Law, and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). The Company represents
that the Board, at a meeting duly called and held on September 30, 2007,
has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in
the best interests of, the holders of Shares, (ii) approved, adopted and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the holders of Shares approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by

  



        
   

  



  

Parent and Purchaser, constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforcement may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (ii) general equitable
principles. The Board has unanimously approved this Agreement and the Merger
and such approvals are sufficient so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203(a) of the DGCL shall not apply to the
Merger. To the knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover statute is
applicable to the Merger.

  



  

SECTION 4.05 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. (a) The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of
this Agreement by the Company will not, and the consummation of the Merger by
the Company will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Company Governing
Documents or any equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any
Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and other
authorizations described in Section 4.05(b) have been obtained and that all
filings and other actions described in Section 4.05(b) have been made or
taken, conflict with or violate any statute, law, ordinance, regulation,
rule, code, executive order, injunction, judgment, decree or other order of
any Governmental Authority (" _Law_ ") applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary
is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to any Material Contract to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or a Subsidiary
or any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement or would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

### (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any United States or non-United States national, state, provincial,
municipal or local government, governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, instrumentality or commission, any non-governmental self-
regulatory agency, instrumentality or commission, any stock exchange or any
court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a " _Governmental Authority_
"), except for (i) applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, (ii)
the premerger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (as amended) and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ "), (iii) the requirements of Section 721 of
Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exon-Florio Provision_ "),
(iv) the notification and approval requirements of Council Regulation No.
139/2004 of the European Community (the " _EC Merger Regulation_ ") or any
consent required and filing requirements under any applicable antitrust,
competition or fair trade Laws of any European Union member state, (v) any
additional consents and filings required under any other applicable foreign
antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws, (vi) the filing and recordation of
appropriate

  



         
 

  



  

### merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (vii) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent
or materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement, or would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### SECTION 4.06   _Permits; Compliance_. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the
Company or the Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the " _Permits_ ") except
where the failure to obtain such Permits would not, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement, or would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
no suspension or cancellation of any material Permits is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of any Law applicable
to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, except where such conflict,
default, breach or violation of any Law would not, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement, or would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary holds or is required to hold any security clearance issued by a
Governmental Authority or is required to be a party to any special security
arrangement with a Governmental Authority to conduct any portion of its
business, except where such failure to hold any security clearance or be
a party to any special security arrangement would not, individually or in
the aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement, or would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### SECTION 4.07   _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_. (a) Since December
31, 2004, the Company has filed all forms, reports and other documents
(including exhibits and other information incorporated therein) required to
be filed by it with the SEC (such documents, as they have been amended since
the respective time of their filing, the " _SEC Reports_ "). The SEC Reports
(i) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with either the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as in effect as of the
respective time of filing of such SEC Reports and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other
document with the SEC.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the SEC Reports was prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_U.S. GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis

  



        
   

  



  

### throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and each fairly presents in accordance with U.S. GAAP, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments and any other adjustments described therein).

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct
copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been filed by the
Company with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other instruments that
previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are currently
in effect.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Company has timely filed all certifications and statements
required by (x) Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (y) 18
U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002)
with respect to any Company SEC Report. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have established and maintain "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act);
such disclosures controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files
with the SEC is communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared; and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to be effective in timely alerting the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
information required to be included in the Companys periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act. The Company has made available to Parent in
the Data Room complete and correct copies of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Company maintains a standard system of accounting established and
administered in accordance with U.S. GAAP in all material respects. The
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
The Company has made available to Parent in the Data Room complete and
correct copies of all written policies and manuals promulgating such internal
accounting controls.

  

### 

  

SECTION 4.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since June 30, 2007,

Company and the Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the
ordinary course, (b) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect and
(c) none of the Company or any Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken
after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the
covenants set forth in Section 6.01.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 4.09 _Absence of Litigation_. Except as set forth in Section 4.09 of
the Disclosure Schedule, there is no litigation, suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation (an " _Action_ ") pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary, or any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, before any Governmental
Authority that individually or in the aggregate, has had or would have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to any
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written
agreement with, or, to the knowledge of the Company, continuing investigation
by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority that would,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

### SECTION 4.10   _Employee Benefit Plans_. (a)  Section 4.10(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all material employee benefit plans (as defined
in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ ")) and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life
insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans,
programs or arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance,
consulting, independent contractor or other contracts or agreements that
provide for notice periods or termination entitlements in excess of
the applicable statutory minimums to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
a party, with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary has any
obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the
Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer or director of, or any current or former consultant to, the Company
or any Subsidiary, (ii) each employee benefit plan for which the Company or
any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event
such plan has been or were to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of
which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section
4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv) any contracts, arrangements or understandings
between the Company or any Subsidiary and any employee, director or officer
of the Company or any Subsidiary relating in any way to a sale of the Company
or any Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Plans_ "). Each Plan is in writing
and the Company has furnished to Parent a true and complete copy of each Plan
and has delivered to Parent a true and complete copy of each material
document, if any, prepared in connection with each such Plan, including (A) a
copy of each trust or other funding arrangement, (B) each summary plan
description and summary of material modifications, (C) the most recently
filed Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 5500, (D) the most recently
received IRS determination letter for each such Plan, and (E) the most

implied commitment, (1) to create, incur liability with respect to or cause
to exist any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (2) to
enter into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits to
any individual except for such contract or agreements with employees who are
hired, and amendments to such contracts or agreements, prior to the Effective
Time other than in accordance with Section 6.01(f) of this Agreement, or (3)
to modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) None of the Plans is (i) a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), (ii) a
single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
ERISA) for which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability
under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "),
or (iii) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 4971
of the Code. Except as disclosed in Section 4.10(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Plans (i) provides for the payment of separation,
severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person, (ii) obligates
the Company or any Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or
similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) obligates the Company or any
Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any benefit as a result of a
"change in control", within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of
the Code. None of the Plans provides for or promises retiree medical,

benefit basis to any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company or any Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have performed all material obligations required to be performed
by them under, are not in any material respect in default under or in
violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or violation by
any party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such Action.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions
applicable to the Plan for which determination letters are currently
available that the Plan is so qualified and each trust established in
connection with any Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter
from the IRS that it is so exempt, and no fact or event has occurred since
the date of such determination letter or letters from the IRS to adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such
trust. There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan.
Each Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to
Section 409A of the Code has been operated in all material respects in good
faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other
guidance promulgated thereunder since January 1, 2005.

  

###

any material liability to the Company or any Subsidiary. All such
contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such
deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and

any such challenge or disallowance.

subject to United States law (a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_"):

procure or provide for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual

current and former participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to
the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan; and

collectively, the " _Intellectual Property Contracts_ "). Except as would

right to privacy or publicity of any third person or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries currently do business. To the knowledge of
the Company, the Company and the Subsidiaries have not intentionally
refrained from commencing operations in any other jurisdiction due to fear of
infringement litigation.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) _No Third Party Infringers_. Except as disclosed in Section 4.14(c)
of the Disclosure Schedule, within the past three years, neither the Company

### (d) _Transaction_. To the knowledge of the Company, no Intellectual
Property Contract or other agreement to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party will require, based solely upon this Agreement and
the Merger, including any assignment to Surviving Corporation by operation of
law as a result of the Merger of any Intellectual Property Contracts or other

Parent, any of Parents affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to grant
to any third person any material incremental right to any non-assertion or
similar obligation under any Company Owned Intellectual Property, (ii)

procure from Parent or any of Parents affiliates a license grant or covenant
not to assert. As used in this Section 4.14(d), an "incremental" right, non-
compete, restriction, royalty or discount refers to a right, non-compete,
restriction, royalty or discount, as applicable, in excess, whether in terms
of contractual term, contractual rate or scope, of those that would have been
required to be offered or granted by the Company or the Subsidiaries, as
applicable, had the parties to this Agreement not entered into this Agreement
or consummated the Merger, but excludes any increase in fees, royalties or
charges based upon an increase in seats, usage, or similar

or a Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound, that, to the knowledge of
the Company: (i) restrict the rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to use, transfer, license or enforce any of the Company Owned
Intellectual Property, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in order to accommodate a third persons

behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries, no such use, development,
incorporation or distribution of such Open Source, or any other use of or
activities with respect to such Open Source by the Company or a Subsidiary

implied license, the licensing, disclosure or distribution of any Source Code
(other than Source Code that is a part of such Open Source) or Company Owned
Intellectual Property to licensees or any other person, (ii) prohibits or

deposited with an escrow agent or any other Person, any Source Code owned by
the Company for products currently used, sold or licensed in the business and

consummation of the Merger will not result in a release of any Company Source
Code or the grant of incremental rights to a person with regard to such
Source Code. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the
disclosure or delivery by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any person
acting on their behalf, to any person of any such escrowed Company Source
Code under any Intellectual Property Contract, and no such escrowed Source
Code has been disclosed, delivered (other than as set forth in Section
4.14(h) of the Disclosure Schedule) or licensed to a third person, excluding

software development, maintenance and disaster recovery services for the
Company or its affiliates.

power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or to have such power, authority and governmental approvals would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from
performing its obligations under this Agreement.

merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal,

reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (ii) general equitable
principles.

  



  

### SECTION 5.04   _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. (a) The

with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give
to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property
or asset of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is a party or by which
Parent or Purchaser or any property or asset of either of them is bound or
affected, except, with respect to clause (iii), for any such breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing its obligations under
this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser
do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will
not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or

the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
DGCL, and (vii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from
performing its obligations under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

SECTION 5.05 _Financing_. Parent will have available at the Closing Date, the
funds necessary to consummate the Merger.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 5.06 _Proxy Statement_. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at the date the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders of
the Company, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or at the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not false or misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the
Stockholders Meeting which shall have become false or misleading.

  



  

SECTION 5.07 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than

the Company capital stock, on the other hand.

  



  

SECTION 5.09 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Neither Parent,
Purchaser, nor any other Person makes any representation or warranty, express
or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
Parent or Purchaser, in each case, except as expressly set forth in this

SECTION 7.01 _Proxy Statement_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of a Proxy Statement in
preliminary and definitive form relating to the meeting of the stockholders
of the Company, including any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than on October 19,
2007) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company
shall furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent and give Parent and
its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
preliminary Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection
therewith. The Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of
the SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and of any
requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall provide to Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable, copies of all written correspondence (and written summaries of
any oral comments) between the Company or any representative of the Company
and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. If comments are received
from the SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the
Company shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to the
comments of the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and its legal counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to each of the preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement
prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith. Parent and
Purchaser shall promptly provide the Company with such information as may be
required to be included in the Proxy Statement or as may be reasonably
required to respond to any comment of the SEC staff. After all the comments
received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC staff and all information
required to be contained in the Proxy Statement have been included therein by
the Company, the Company shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the
SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed (including by electronic
delivery if permitted) as promptly as reasonably practicable, to its
stockholders of record, as of the record date established by the Board. Each
of the parties shall correct promptly, any information provided by it to be
used specifically in the Proxy Statement, if required, that shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps
necessary to file with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the
Proxy Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case to the extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

SECTION 7.02 _Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Board,
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Companys Governing
Documents, (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders (and in any event no later than
thirty (30) days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement) for the purpose of
considering and taking action on this Agreement and the Merger (the "
_Stockholders  Meeting_") and (ii) (A) include in the Proxy Statement, a
statement to the effect that the Board has recommended that the stockholders
of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, unless the
Board has effected a Change in Board Recommendation in accordance with

  



         
 

  



  

Section 7.04, and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval
and adoption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may only adjourn or
postpone the Stockholders Meeting with the consent of Parent to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time the
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient Shares of Company voting stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that no adjournment may
be to a date on or after three (3) Business Days prior to the date set forth
in Section 9.01(b)(i).

  



  

SECTION 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a)  From the date
hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall authorize the

and agents of Parent and Purchaser and persons providing or proposing to
provide Parent or Purchaser with financing for the Merger, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the Company and
each Subsidiary, and shall furnish Parent and Purchaser and persons providing
or proposing to provide Parent or Purchaser with financing for the Merger
with such financial, operating and other data and information as Parent or
Purchaser, through its officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request,
including information relating to the Companys and any of its subsidiaries
use of Open Source, in all cases to the extent permissible under applicable
Law.

  



  

(b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.03 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated August 28, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
between Parent and the Company.

  



  

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto or any condition to the
Merger.

  



  

SECTION 7.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. (a)  Subject to the
provisions of Section 7.04(c) and (d), neither of the Company or any
Subsidiary shall, nor shall either of them authorize or permit any of the
directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other
retained representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant) of the Company or any Subsidiary, to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic
information), or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Competing Transaction, (ii) enter into or maintain or continue
discussions or negotiations with any person or entity in furtherance of such
inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction, or
(iii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any Competing Transaction or
enter into any letter of intent or other contract, agreement, commitment or
understanding contemplating or otherwise relating to any Competing
Transaction (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as
contemplated by Section 7.04(c)); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 7.04 shall preclude the Company or its representatives from
contacting any person for the sole purpose of complying with the penultimate
sentence of this Section 7.04(a). The Company shall, and shall direct or
cause its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees,

  



        
   

  



  

agents, advisors and other retained representatives to (i) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties
that may have been conducted heretofore with respect to a
Competing Transaction and (ii) cause any physical or virtual data room
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Data Room) no longer to be
accessible to or by any person other than Parent and its representatives,
affiliates and advisors and the Company and its representatives, affiliates
and advisors. The Company shall not release any third person from or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party unless the Board determines in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel that it would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to not provide such release or waiver.

  



  

(b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly orally and then promptly in
writing (and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after it or any
of its Subsidiaries has received any proposal, inquiry or offer (or any
amendment thereto) that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Competing Transaction, any request for discussions or negotiations in
connection with a Competing Transaction or a potential Competing Transaction
or any request for access to the properties or books and records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such notice shall include a description
of the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request (including any amendments thereto)
regarding a Competing Transaction.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares in favor of adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company
Required Vote_ "), the Company may furnish information to, including
nonpublic information, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, a
person who has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer
regarding a Competing Transaction, if the Board has (i) determined, in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Competing Transaction is, or is reasonably likely to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, (ii) determined, in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that, in light of such determination that such
Competing Transaction is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, the failure to furnish such information or enter into such
discussions or negotiations would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, (iii) provided written notice to
Parent of its determinations described in clauses (i) and (ii) above and
provided the required information pursuant to Section 7.04(b), and (iv)
obtained from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, including a standstill provision substantially similar to the
standstill provision included in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement or any other related agreement
shall not include any provision having the effect of prohibiting the Company
from satisfying its material obligations under this Agreement) (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(d) The Company may, prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, (i)
withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the
recommendation of the Board of this Agreement and the Merger in favor of a
Superior Proposal (a " _Change in Board Recommendation_ "); and (ii) accept,
approve, endorse or recommend a Superior Proposal, but in each case, if and
only to the extent that:

  



        
   

  



  

(i) The Company shall have received an unsolicited bona fide written
Competing Transaction from such person (in circumstances not involving any
breach of this Section 7.04);

  



  

(ii) The Board shall have determined, in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Transaction constitutes a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii) The Board shall have determined, in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law;

  



  

(iv) The Company shall have provided written notice to Parent at least three
(3) Business Days prior to making such Change in Board Recommendation or
publicly announcing that it may make such Change in Board Recommendation
which notice shall state expressly (A) that the Company has received a
Superior Proposal, (B) a description of the final terms and conditions of,
and the identity of the person or persons making the Superior Proposal and a
copy of the latest draft of the agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal (and any amendments thereto) and (C) that the Board intends to
effect a Change in Board Recommendation (and the Board shall keep Parent
reasonably apprised of any developments with respect to such Superior
Proposal, including any changes in any material terms during such period);

  



  

(v) The Company shall have provided Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
make such changes or adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement during such three (3) Business Day period, and negotiate in good
faith with respect thereto, as would enable the Board to proceed with its
recommendation to the Companys stockholders in favor of adoption of this
Agreement without making a Change in Board Recommendation; and

  



  

(vi) The Board shall have determined in good faith (A) after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Superior
Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal as compared to the terms and
conditions of the Merger and this Agreement as proposed to be changed or
adjusted by Parent and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to effect a Change in Board Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, and has
given Parent written notice of such determination promptly upon such
determination.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be entitled to enter
into any definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this
Agreement has been, or concurrently is, terminated by its terms pursuant to
Section 9.01(c)(i) or Section 9.01(d)(i) and the Company has paid,
or concurrently with such termination pays, the Fee due to Parent pursuant
to Section 9.03.

and benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that in the aggregate are
not less favorable than the overall compensation levels and benefits
(excluding equity-based compensation) maintained for and provided to such
Company employees as of the date hereof. From and after the Effective Time,
employees of the Company or any subsidiary shall receive credit for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement (other than equity-based compensation plans)
established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective
Time with the Company or any subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit or in an unusual or unintended increase in
such benefit; _provided_ , _further_ , to the extent that an employee of
the Company or any subsidiary is paid severance in connection with the
Merger, such employee shall not be provided with full credit for service
recognized by the Surviving Corporation for purposes of any future severance

and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under applicable provisions of Delaware law relating to
indemnification of directors and officers, under the Companys Governing
Documents in effect as of the date hereof, and under any and
all indemnification agreements in effect as of the date hereof between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former directors or officers and any person who becomes a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
with respect to any matter arising out of, relating to, or in connection with
any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the
Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the Merger. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and
its Subsidiaries to, advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation with respect to any matters subject to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 7.06 pursuant to the procedures set forth, and to the fullest
extent provided in the Companys Governing Documents or such indemnification
agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to any such advance, any
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced shall sign a written
undertaking to repay such advanced expenses to the Surviving Corporation as
soon as reasonably practicable if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification or advancement. Further,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries not
to, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim by
or before any Governmental Authority, with respect to any matter arising out
of, relating to, or in connection with any acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time (in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party under
Delaware law, the indemnification provisions in the Companys Governing
Documents or his or her indemnification agreement), brought against any
Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing and

  



        
   

  



  

Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause its
or their Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  



  

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses with respect to any
matter arising out of, relating to, or in connection with any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time
than are set forth in the Companys Governing Documents in effect as of the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party, unless
such modification shall be required by law. In addition, all indemnification
agreements with Indemnified Parties in existence on the date of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries to,
maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time all directors and
officers liability insurance policies (" _D andO Insurance_") currently
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any matter
arising out of, relating to, or in connection with any acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time, including
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, provided
that the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the insured
with such policy or policies underwritten by a carrier with the same or
better A.M. Best rating (and provided, further, that such substitution shall
not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring
before the Effective Time); _further_ ,  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.06(c) more than an amount per
year equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) **** of current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (which premiums the Company
represents and warrants to be approximately eight hundred seventy thousand
dollars ($870,000) in the aggregate). In the event that, but for the proviso
to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, would be required to expend more than two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, to
obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual
premiums equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may, on behalf
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, elect to obtain
prepaid insurance policies prior to the Effective Time, which policies
provide the Indemnified Parties with DandO Insurance coverage of equivalent
amount and on at least as favorable terms in the aggregate as that provided
by the Companys current DandO Insurance policies for an aggregate period of at
least six years with respect to claims arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the Merger. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, which the Company may only obtain with the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld)
Parent shall, and shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation,

  



        
   

  



  

as applicable to, maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  



  

(d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents
option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.

  



  

(e) This Section 7.06 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and Surviving Corporation.
This Section 7.06 shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the
Indemnified Parties (including their successors and heirs) or terminated
without the consent of the Indemnified Parties (including their successors
and heirs) affected thereby. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 7.06.

  



  

SECTION 7.07 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and each of
Parent and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated
thereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent purports to
materially affect the consummation of the Merger, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against such party or any of its subsidiaries which
purports to materially affect the consummation of the Merger, (iii)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, and (iv) any failure of the Company, Parent or Purchaser,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

  



  

SECTION 7.08 _Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter

Regulation or other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust,
competition or fair trade Laws with respect to the Merger and (ii) use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
Merger, including using its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain
all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders
of Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the
Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Merger and
to fulfill the conditions to the Merger. Parent and

  



        
   

  



  

Purchaser shall promptly submit the voluntary notice of the Merger to the
Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("
_CFIUS_ ") provided for in 31 C.F.R. §§ 800.401-.402 and pursuant to the
Exon-Florio Provision (the " _CFIUS Filing_ "), and each of the parties
hereto shall make such additional filings and submissions as may be
reasonably advisable under the Exon-Florio Provision in respect of the
Merger. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to take all such action. Each of the
parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to (i) vigorously contest and resist any Action instituted or brought
by a third party, including administrative or judicial Action that seeks to
restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the Merger, and (ii) have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect
and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger,
including in each case, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in the event that undertakings, conditions or other actions
are requested of Parent, Purchaser or Nokia by any Governmental Authority as
a condition to such Governmental Authoritys consent to, approval of, or
determination or agreement not to enjoin, make illegal or materially delay,
the Merger, Parent, Purchaser and Nokia hereby undertake and agree to take
all necessary action to agree to a FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-
discriminatory) license of products (but not services) of the Company (as
they currently exist and are licensed or sold by the Company and as they may
be modified or further developed in the future, including non-discrimination
in the frequency, modes and methods by which such products are delivered) on
terms acceptable to the relevant Governmental Authority, so as to permit the
Merger to be completed.

  



  

(b) Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any material
communication it receives from any Governmental Authority relating to any
filings, or submissions under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any
applicable merger Laws of any European Union member state that has
jurisdiction to review the Merger, the Exon-Florio Provision or other
applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade
Laws, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the CFIUS Filing. Each party
agrees to provide promptly to the other party all necessary information and
assistance as any Governmental Authority may from time to time require in
connection with obtaining the relevant approvals, consents or expiration of
waiting periods in relation to these filings. Each party shall promptly
provide all reasonable assistance and cooperation to allow the other party to
prepare and submit any filings, or submissions under the HSR Act, the EC
Merger Regulation, the Exon-Florio Provision (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the CFIUS Filing) or other applicable foreign, federal or state
antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws, including providing to the other
any information that the other party may from time to time require for the
purpose of any filing, notification, application or request for further
information made in respect of any such filing.

  



  

SECTION 7.09 _Public Announcements_. Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree
that no public release or announcement concerning the Merger shall be issued
by either party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement
may be required by Law or Governmental Authority, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable efforts
to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or

  



        
   

  



  

announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the
form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the execution of this

Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to have terminated without further
action by the parties thereto.

Parent of the assets of Parent, its subsidiaries or the Company or
its subsidiaries or the failure of a waiting period to expire or be
terminated or the failure to obtain any required approval would not subject
Parent or Purchaser to the payment of a material fine or penalty;

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 9.03, and subject to Section 10.11,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to
any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Fee is payable,
except for cases of bad faith, the payment of the Fee shall, in light of
the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute
liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim
which Parent and Purchaser would otherwise be entitled to assert against the
Company or any of its assets, or against any of its directors, officers,
employees and stockholders with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and except for cases of bad faith, shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Purchaser.
Except for nonpayment of the Fee and in the event of bad faith, the parties
hereby agree that, upon termination of this Agreement in circumstances where
the Fee is payable, in no event shall Parent or Purchaser (i) seek to obtain
any recovery or judgment against the Company or any of its assets, or against
any of its directors, officers, employees or stockholders or (ii) be entitled
to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including, consequential,
indirect or punitive damages.

  



  

SECTION 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at
any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made that would reduce the
amount or change the type of consideration into which each Share shall be
converted upon consummation of the Merger or which by law requires further
approval of the stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

SECTION 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with
any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Any delay by a party in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

SECTION 10.02 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any
Law, or due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and the

circumstances will be interpreted so as to effect the intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible so that the Merger be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so

Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto (and any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect), except
that Purchaser may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder

assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 10.06 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that

courts.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees to waive any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect to any action
