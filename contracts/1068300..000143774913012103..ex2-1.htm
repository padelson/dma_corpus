 **Article II 
CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 



 

Section 2.1 _Merger Consideration_. Unless otherwise adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.2, each MetroCorp Share issued and outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time, but excluding (x) any shares to be cancelled and retired
in accordance with Section 2.1(b), and (y) any Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 2.5 hereof) (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive from East
West, without interest, the sum of the Per Share Cash Consideration and the
Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

(a) The terms used in this Section 2.1 shall have the following meanings:

 



 

" _Adjusted Tangible Equity of MetroCorp_ " shall mean the tangible equity of
MetroCorp as reflected in the Closing Financial Statements, minus (a)
$7,000,000 and minus (b) the amount of investment banker transaction or
advisor fees, net of tax (which shall not include the cost of the fairness
opinion by the Financial Advisor); plus (x) the first $2,500,000 of any pre-
tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities above the unrealized
loss amount as of August 31, 2013, and (y) severance costs of any employees
who are entitled to severance or change of control payments or other amounts
as a result of their employment being terminated by East West at the time of
Closing.

 



 

" _Average Closing Price_ " shall mean the volume-weighted average of the
closing price of East West Common Shares as reported in The Wall Street
Journal (Western Edition) for the sixty (60) trading days of the NASDAQ Global
Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") ending with the fifth trading day prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

" _Closing Financial Statements_ " shall mean the consolidated financial
statements presenting the financial condition of MetroCorp and its
Subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulatory accounting
principles and other applicable legal and accounting requirements, and
reflecting all period-end accruals and other adjustments, as of the close of
business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that if the Effective Time occurs on or before the fifth
day of the month, the Closing Financial Statements shall be as of and through
the last day of the second month preceding the Effective Time. Such Closing
Financial Statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of MetroCorp's
Chief Financial Officer certifying as to the true and accuracy thereof.

 



 

 



   



 



 

" _Merger Consideration_ " shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of MetroCorp Common Shares outstanding (except for Excluded Shares)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the lesser of (A) $14.60 per
share and (B) 1.72 times the Per Share Tangible Equity.

 



 

" _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " shall mean one-third of the Per Share
Merger Consideration which shall be payable in cash.

 



 

" _Per Share Merger Consideration_ " shall mean the amount derived by dividing
the Merger Consideration by the number of MetroCorp Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

" _Per Share Stock Consideration_ " shall mean that number of East West Common
Shares derived by dividing two-thirds of the Per Share Merger Consideration by
the Average Closing Price; provided, however, if the Average Closing Price is
less than $28.00, then the number of East West Common Shares issuable as Per
Share Stock Consideration shall be derived by dividing two-thirds of the Per
Share Merger Consideration by $28.00 and if the Average Closing Price is
greater than $32.00, then the number of East West Common Shares issuable as
Per Share Stock Consideration shall be derived by dividing two-thirds of the
Per Share Merger Consideration by $32.00.

 



 

" _Per Share Tangible Equity_ " shall mean the Adjusted Tangible Equity of
MetroCorp divided by the number of MetroCorp Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Each MetroCorp Share that is owned (as treasury stock or otherwise) by
East West or MetroCorp or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiaries (other than (i) MetroCorp Shares held, directly or
indirectly, in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties and (ii)
MetroCorp Shares held in respect of a debt previously contracted) shall
automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion and no payment
or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, East West
will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional East West
Common Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional shares, East West shall pay to each former
holder of MetroCorp Shares otherwise entitled to receive such fractional share
an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the Average Closing Price of
East West Common Shares by (ii) the fraction of an East West Common Share
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 2.1.

 



 

 



   



 



 

Section 2.2 _Adjustments to Per Share Stock Consideration_. The
aggregate number of East West Common Shares to be exchanged for each MetroCorp
Share shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any change in the number of
East West Common Shares by reason of any stock dividends or splits,
reclassification, recapitalization or conversion with respect to East West
Common Shares, received or to be received by holders of East West Common
Shares, when the record date or payment occurs before the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of MetroCorp Awards_.

 



 

(a) In accordance with the terms of MetroCorp's equity incentive plans and
each underlying award agreement, each option to acquire MetroCorp Shares ("
_MetroCorp Options_ ") that is not otherwise immediately exercisable will
become fully exercisable upon the approval of this Agreement by MetroCorp's
shareholders at the MetroCorp Special Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1). The
compensation committee of the Board of Directors of MetroCorp (the "
_MetroCorp Board_ ") shall set a date (which date will be at least two (2)
business days before the Effective Time) (the " _Specified Date_ ") before
which all MetroCorp Options may be exercised by the holder thereof in
accordance with its terms. MetroCorp may provide for cashless exercise of the
MetroCorp Options; provided that any adjustment to allow for cashless exercise
of any MetroCorp Options which are "incentive stock options" under Section 422
of the Code shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. Immediately after the Effective
Time, all unexercised MetroCorp Options will terminate and East West will pay
to the holder of each such MetroCorp Option the amount needed to cash out the
MetroCorp Options pursuant to the terms of MetroCorp's equity incentive plans,
as applicable, less any Taxes required to be withheld.

 



 

(b) MetroCorp shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each restricted stock award and other right, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive MetroCorp Common Shares or benefits measured by the value
of such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of MetroCorp Common
Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for
issuance under the MetroCorp Bancshares, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan or the
MetroCorp Bancshares, Inc. 2007 Stock Awards and Incentive Plan, other than
MetroCorp Options (each, a " _MetroCorp Stock Award_ ") immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action, cancelled and converted
into the right to receive from East West and the Surviving Corporation, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration, less any Taxes required to be withheld.

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, MetroCorp, MetroCorp Board and the
compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee consents)
that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this Section 2.3.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Warrant_. The holder of the warrant to
purchase 771,429 MetroCorp Common Shares originally issued to the United
States Treasury, on January 16, 2009 (the " _Warrant_ "), shall, if the
Warrant is exercised at or prior to the Effective Time, receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration in exchange for the MetroCorp Common Shares held by it or
to which it is entitled under the Warrant. If not exercised at or prior to the
Effective Time, the obligations of MetroCorp under the Warrant that survive
the Effective Date shall be assumed by East West.

 



 

 



   



 



 

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of MetroCorp Shares issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, the holder of which has
voted against the approval of the Merger and who has properly perfected such
holder's dissenter's rights of appraisal by following the exact procedure
required by Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the Texas Business Organizations Code
(" _TBOC_ ") is referred to herein as a " _Dissenting Share_." Each Dissenting
Share shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article II and shall be entitled only to such
rights as are available to such holder pursuant to the applicable provisions
of the TBOC. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the
value of such Dissenting Shares held by such holder in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the TBOC; _provided_ that such holder complies with
the procedures contemplated by and set forth in the applicable provisions of
the TBOC. If any holder of any Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or
lose such holder's dissenter's rights under the applicable provisions of the
TBOC, each such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions
of this Article II.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, East West shall deposit or cause to be
deposited in trust with an exchange agent mutually agreed upon by East West
and MetroCorp (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") (i) certificates representing East
West Common Shares, and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to make
the appropriate payments (A) of the Per Share Cash Consideration, as may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1, (B) to holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 2.5, if any, and (C) to holders of a fraction of a share of East
West Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such certificates and cash
being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement. MetroCorp
shall notify East West in writing prior to the Effective Time of the number of
MetroCorp Shares and Excluded Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, with the intent to be
within ten (10) business days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (or in the case of the
Depository Trust Company on behalf of "street name" holders, to deliver) to
each record holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates which, as of
the Effective Time, represented MetroCorp Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
(other than Excluded Shares) or book-entry shares which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented MetroCorp Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") as
of that date a letter of transmittal that will specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate(s) (or affidavit(s)
of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s)) or Book-Entry Shares and instructions
for surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent,
in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which MetroCorp Shares
represented by such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares will have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transmittal
Materials_ "). The form and substance of the Transmittal Materials are to be
acceptable to East West and MetroCorp before they are mailed to the holders of
the Certificates or delivered to the holders of Book-Entry Shares. Upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares,
together with the Transmittal Materials duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash and number of East West Common Shares provided in
Section 2.1, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2, and such
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. East West
shall provide the Exchange Agent with certificates for East West Common
Shares, as requested by the Exchange Agent, for the number of certificated
shares provided in Section 2.1, as may be adjusted. No interest will be paid
or accrued with respect to the East West Common Shares or cash payable upon
surrender of the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.6, after the Effective Time,
each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Excluded Shares) shall
represent for all purposes the right to receive the Merger Consideration
without any interest thereon.

 



 

 



   



 



 

(c) Promptly after receipt of such Transmittal Materials, East West will
cause the Exchange Agent to review the Transmittal Materials in order to
verify proper completion and execution thereof. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time or within five (5) calendar days after surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with properly
completed and executed Transmittal Materials, East West will cause the
Exchange Agent to pay to the former stockholder of MetroCorp the Per Share
Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of MetroCorp Shares represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and issue certificates or shares in
book-entry form for East West Common Shares equal to the Per Share Stock
Consideration multiplied by the number of MetroCorp Shares represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) Former shareholders of record of MetroCorp shall not be entitled to
vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of East West stockholders until
such holders have exchanged their certificates representing MetroCorp Common
Shares for certificates representing East West Common Shares in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared after the Effective Time with respect to East West Common Shares and
payable to the holders thereof shall be paid to the holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares until such holder surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares and duly executed Transmittal Materials to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with this Section 2.6. After the surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares and duly executed Transmittal Materials in accordance with
this Section 2.6, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which had become
payable after the Effective Time with respect to the East West Common Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, the share transfer ledger of MetroCorp shall
be closed and there shall be no transfers on the share transfer books of
MetroCorp for MetroCorp Shares which were outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to East West, they shall be promptly presented to the
Exchange Agent and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.6.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of MetroCorp
for six months after the Exchange Agent mails the Transmittal Materials
pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be returned to East West upon demand, and
any stockholders of MetroCorp who have not theretofore complied with the
exchange procedures in this Article II shall look to East West only, and not
the Exchange Agent, for the payment of any Merger Consideration in respect of
such shares.

 



 

 



   



 



 

(g) If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing East West Common
Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be
a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) or otherwise be in proper form (reasonably satisfactory to East
West) for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing East West Common Shares in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or not
payable.

 



 

(h) None of East West, MetroCorp, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of MetroCorp Shares for any East West
Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(i) If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by East West or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount (not to exceed the amount
of Merger Consideration relating to the relevant missing Certificate) as East
West or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against East West with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

maintained to ensure that all information (both financial and nonfinancial)
required to be disclosed by MetroCorp in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to MetroCorp's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of MetroCorp required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

 



 

(f) Except for (i) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved
for in the consolidated financial statements of MetroCorp included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2013, as
filed with the SEC, (ii) this Agreement, or (iii) liabilities incurred since
June 30, 2013, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, neither MetroCorp nor any Subsidiary thereof has incurred any
material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued or
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due).

 



 

(g) Since January 1, 2012, (i) neither MetroCorp nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of MetroCorp, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of MetroCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise obtained knowledge of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding

(h) Neither MetroCorp nor any Subsidiary thereof is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
MetroCorp and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangement"), where the purpose or intended effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, MetroCorp or any of its Subsidiaries in MetroCorp's
or such Subsidiary's financial statements.

 



 

(i) The books and records of MetroCorp and any of its Subsidiaries are in
all material respects complete and accurate and have been maintained in the
ordinary course of business and in accordance with applicable laws and
accounting requirements. The records, systems, controls, data and information
of MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photograph
processes, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of MetroCorp or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any nonexclusive
ownership and nondirect control that would not reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on MetroCorp's system of internal accounting
controls described in the next sentence. MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries
maintain internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. MetroCorp has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation

material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
would be reasonably likely to adversely affect MetroCorp's ability to
accurately record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in MetroCorp's internal controls over
financial reporting.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as
disclosed in MetroCorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2012, or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended
June 30, 2013, and March 31, 2013, or in any other filing made by MetroCorp
with the SEC since December 31, 2012, since December 31, 2012: (i) neither
MetroCorp nor any Subsidiary thereof has incurred any material liability of a
nature required to be disclosed in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with
GAAP and regulatory accounting principles, except as contemplated by the
Agreement or in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past
practices; (ii) no event has occurred which has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on MetroCorp; and (iii) MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries have carried on their

Section 3.7 _Loan Portfolio and Reserve for Loan Losses_.

 



 

(a) All evidences of indebtedness and leases of the Banks (each, a "
_Loan_ " and collectively, the " _Loans_ "), including any renewals and
extensions of any Loan, were solicited, originated and currently exist in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
federal and state law and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Loans are
adequately documented, and each note evidencing a Loan or credit agreement or
security instrument related to a Loan constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the obligor thereunder, enforceable in accordance with the terms
thereof, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency or other laws affecting creditors' rights, and all actions
necessary to protect any related security interest have been duly taken.
Neither Bank has entered into any oral modifications or amendments or
additional agreements related to the Loans that are not reflected in its
records. To MetroCorp's Knowledge, there is no valid claim or defense to the
enforcement of any Loan and none has been asserted, and the Banks are not
aware of any acts or omissions that would give rise to any claim or right of
rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense.

 



 

(b) The credit files of the Banks contain all material information
(excluding general, local or national industry, economic or similar
conditions) Known to MetroCorp that is reasonably required to evaluate in
accordance with generally prevailing practices in the banking industry the
collectibility of the loan portfolio of the Banks (including loans that will
be outstanding if it advances funds it is obligated to advance).

 



 

(c) The allowance for loan losses shown on MetroCorp Financial Statements
as of June 30, 2013, was, and the allowance for loan losses to be shown on any
financial statements of MetroCorp or the Banks or Call Reports of the Banks as
of any date subsequent to the execution of this Agreement will be, calculated
in accordance with GAAP in all material respects as applied to banking
institutions and all applicable rules and regulations, and in the reasonable
opinion of MetroCorp, adequate in all respects to provide for all possible
losses, net of recoveries relating to loans previously charged off, on Loans
outstanding (including accrued interest receivable) of the Banks and other
extensions of credit (including letters of credit or commitments to make loans
or extend credit); _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or warranty
is made as to the sufficiency of collateral securing or the collectibility of
such loans.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Certain Loans and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(a)_, MetroCorp is not a party to
any written or oral (i) loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement, other

delinquent in payment of principal or interest or in default of any other
material provisions as of the date hereof; (ii) loan agreement, note or
borrowing arrangement which has been classified as "substandard," "doubtful,"
"loss," "other loans especially mentioned," "other assets especially
mentioned" or any comparable classifications by such persons; (iii) loan
agreement, note or borrowing arrangement, including any loan guaranty, with
any director or executive officer of MetroCorp, or any ten percent (10%) or
more stockholder of MetroCorp, or any person, corporation or enterprise
controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of the foregoing;
or (iv) loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement in violation of any law,
regulation or rule applicable to MetroCorp including, but not limited to,

representative, guardian, conservator or investment adviser, in accordance
with the terms of the governing documents and applicable law in all material
respects, and none of MetroCorp or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice
of any failure to properly administer any accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary. Since January 1, 2012, none of MetroCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of MetroCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such

hold all licenses, registrations, franchises, certificates, variances, permits

are not and have not been in violation of any, applicable Laws, except in each
case where the failure to hold such license, registration, franchise,
certificate, variance, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or
violation would not be material to MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and neither MetroCorp nor any Subsidiary thereof has Knowledge of, or
has received notice of, any violations of any of the above, except for such
violations that would not be material to MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, MetroCorp has
not been advised of any regulatory concerns regarding its compliance with (i)
the Bank Secrecy Act or related state or federal anti-money laundering laws,
regulations and guidelines; (ii) consumer lending, deposit and savings and
related operations laws and regulations, including the Equal Credit

Reinvestment Act was "satisfactory," and subsequently, the Banks have not
received any complaints as to Community Reinvestment Act compliance.

operation or maintenance thereof, violates in any manner any restrictive
covenants or encroaches on any property owned by others, nor does any building
or structure of third parties encroach upon any MetroCorp Real Property,

(c) Other than routine claims for benefits, there is no pending or, to
MetroCorp's Knowledge, threatened litigation, administrative action,
investigation, audit or similar proceeding relating to any MetroCorp Employee

reasonably give rise to any such action or proceeding with respect to any
MetroCorp Employee Plan. All of MetroCorp Employee Plans comply in all
material respects and have been administered in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. There
has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to MetroCorp Employee Plans that is

law or by any MetroCorp Employee Plan have been made by the due date thereof.

post-retirement or post-employment health, life or any other welfare benefits
under any MetroCorp Employee Plan or otherwise, except for coverage required
by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, or similar state
laws, the cost of which is borne by the covered individuals. Each MetroCorp
Employee Plan that is sponsored by MetroCorp and intended to be a "qualified
plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is qualified in form
and operation in all material respects, and each VEBA is exempt from federal
income tax, and MetroCorp is not aware of any event or circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to disqualify any such MetroCorp Employee Plan or cause
a VEBA to lose its tax-exempt status. Each MetroCorp Employee Plan that is
intended to be a "qualified plan" and each VEBA has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to its tax-exempt
status, or (in the case of a "qualified plan") is the adoption of a prototype
plan or volume submitter plan which is the subject of an Internal Revenue
Service favorable opinion letter upon which MetroCorp may rely.

 



 

(e) (i) neither MetroCorp nor any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) has
any liability or contingent liability with respect to a "multiemployer plan"

or a plan described in Section 413(c) of the Code; (ii) none of MetroCorp or
any of its respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six
(6) years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
Plan, and none of MetroCorp or any of its respective ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any withdrawal liability under Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA that has not been satisfied in full; (iii) neither MetroCorp nor any
ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains or contributes to any employee benefit
plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and none of MetroCorp or any of its
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years,
sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; and (iv) neither MetroCorp nor any ERISA
Affiliate has withdrawn from any plan in a manner that would subject any such
entity to liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.

 



 

 



   



 



 

(f) There does not now exist, nor, to MetroCorp's Knowledge, do any
circumstances exist that would reasonably result in, any Controlled Group
Liability that would be a material liability of MetroCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries now or following the Closing. " _Controlled Group Liability_ "
means any and all liabilities (1) under Title IV of ERISA, (2) under Section
302 of ERISA, (3) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (4) as a result of
a failure to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601
et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, and (5) under corresponding or
similar provisions of foreign laws or regulations.

 



 

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.23(g)_ , there is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee or former employee of
MetroCorp or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably give rise to the payment by MetroCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms
of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.23(g)_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of MetroCorp or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any
limitation on the right of MetroCorp or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,

respect to any such fiduciary account that would be material to East West and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the accountings for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct in all material respects and accurately
reflect in all material respects the assets of such fiduciary account.

 



 

(c) East West and each insured depository Subsidiary of East West meet or
exceed the criteria to be deemed "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined
in the relevant regulation of the institution's primary federal bank
regulator) and "well managed" (as that term is defined at 12 C.F.R. 225.2(s)
or the relevant regulation of the institution's primary bank regulator).

judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed before, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part
out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she was acting in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of MetroCorp or the Banks to the fullest
extent that the Indemnified Party would be entitled under the Articles of
Incorporation or Articles of Association, as applicable, of MetroCorp and the
Banks, in each case as in effect on the date hereof and to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 6.6, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, is to promptly notify East West, but the failure to so notify
will not relieve East West of any liability it may have to the Indemnified
Party to the extent such failure does not prejudice East West. In any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) East West will have the right to assume the
defense thereof, and East West will not be liable to an Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if East West elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Party advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of
interest between East West and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to East West, and East West will
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party
(which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified
Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) East West will
not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent,
and (iv) East West will have no obligation hereunder if indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations.

MUTUAL COVENANTS OF EAST WEST 
AND METROCORP

 



 

Section 7.1 _Notification; Updated Disclosure Schedules_. MetroCorp
shall give prompt notice to East West, and East West shall give prompt notice
to MetroCorp, of (a) any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, including,
without limitation, as a result of any change in a Disclosure Schedule, or (b)
the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that if such notification under clause (a)
relates to any matter that arises for the first time after the date of this
Agreement, then the other party may only terminate this Agreement if such
matter would cause the condition set forth in Section 10.3 with respect to
MetroCorp, and in Section 11.3 with respect to East West, incapable of being
satisfied.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) East West and MetroCorp agree that the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated August 19, 2013, between East West and MetroCorp (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") are incorporated into this Agreement by
reference and shall continue in full force and effect and shall be binding on
East West and MetroCorp and their respective officers, directors, employees,
other Affiliates and representatives as if parties thereto, in accordance with
the terms thereof.

 



 

(b) MetroCorp's officers, directors, employees, other Affiliates and
representatives shall hold in confidence all documents and information
concerning East West, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
after the Effective Time, unless required to disclose such information
pursuant to order, request or demand of a governmental authority or by
judicial or administrative process or by law.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by applicable law
or securities exchange rules or in connection with the regulatory application
process, as long as this Agreement is in effect, neither East West nor
MetroCorp shall, nor shall they permit any of their officers, directors or
representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public announcement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) To the extent requested by East West at least 30 days before the
Effective Time, MetroCorp or its appropriate Subsidiary shall execute and
deliver such instruments and take such other actions as East West may
reasonably require in order to cause the amendment or termination of any
MetroCorp Employee Plan on terms satisfactory to East West and in accordance
with applicable law and effective no later than the Closing Date, except that
the winding up of any such plan may be completed following the Closing Date,
provided MetroCorp or its Subsidiary has used its reasonable best efforts to
complete the winding up of any such plan prior to the Closing Date. East West
agrees that the employees of MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries who continue their
employment after the Closing Date (the " _MetroCorp Employees_ ") will be
entitled to participate as newly hired employees in the employee benefit plans
and programs maintained for employees of East West and East West Bank, subject
to the granting of credit for prior service as provided below, in accordance
with the respective terms of such plans and programs, and East West shall take
all actions necessary or appropriate to facilitate coverage of MetroCorp
Employees in such plans and programs and the granting of such credit from and
after the Closing Date, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 7.4.

 



 

 



   



 



 

(b) For all purposes under the employee welfare benefit plans and other
employee benefit plans and programs (excluding vesting requirements under
stock incentive plans) sponsored by East West or East West Bank, each
MetroCorp Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with
MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such MetroCorp Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
MetroCorp Employee Plan in which such MetroCorp Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by such East West plans and applicable law. To the extent permitted
by such East West plans and applicable law, any eligibility waiting period and
preexisting condition exclusion applicable to such plans and programs shall be
waived with respect to each MetroCorp Employee and his or her eligible
dependents. To the extent permitted by the applicable East West plans and
applicable law, East West further agrees to credit each MetroCorp Employee and
his or her eligible dependents for the year during which coverage under East
West's group health plan begins, with any deductibles, co-payments, or out-of-
pocket payments already incurred by such MetroCorp Employee during such year
under MetroCorp's group health plan. Without limiting the foregoing, East West
shall extend coverage to MetroCorp Employees for health care, dependent care
and limited purpose health care flexible spending accounts established under
Section 125 of the Code to the same extent as available to similarly situated
employees of East West or its Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by such
East West plans and applicable law. East West shall give effect to any
elections made by MetroCorp Employees with respect to such accounts to the
extent permitted by such East West plan and applicable law. MetroCorp
Employees shall be credited with amounts available for reimbursement equal to
such amounts as were credited under MetroCorp's plan to the extent permitted
by such East West plan and applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that waiving such conditions or crediting such amounts requires the
consent of East West's or East West Bank's health insurance carrier, East West
shall only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
carrier to waive such conditions and credit such amounts. For purposes of
determining each MetroCorp Employee's benefits for the calendar year in which
the Merger occurs under East West's vacation program, any vacation taken by a
MetroCorp Employee immediately preceding the Closing Date for the calendar
year in which the Merger occurs will be deducted from the total East West
vacation benefit available to such MetroCorp Employee for such calendar year.

 



 

(c) MetroCorp shall take any and all actions reasonably requested by East
West that may be necessary or advisable to terminate the MetroCorp 401(k) and
Profit Sharing Plan (the " _MetroCorp 401(k) Plan_ "), effective at least one
day prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of the MetroCorp
401(k) Plan and the requirements of the Code, ERISA and other applicable laws,
and on a basis satisfactory to East West in its reasonable judgment. Each
active employee of MetroCorp and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date shall
be fully vested in his or her account balances under the MetroCorp 401(k) Plan
as of the Closing Date, and shall be entitled to distribution of such vested
balances in accordance with the terms of the MetroCorp 401(k) Plan (following
the receipt of a favorable determination letter on plan termination from the
Internal Revenue Service). East West shall take reasonable actions to allow
active employees of MetroCorp, as of the Closing Date receiving distributions
of their MetroCorp 401(k) Plan account balances, to roll over such
distributions (including loans) to East West's 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan.

 



 

 



   



 



 

Section 7.5 _Assumption of Outstanding Trust Preferred Issues_. As
soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, MetroCorp shall
notify the trustee with respect to the Trust Preferred Issue, or any successor
trustee named for purposes of the Trust Preferred Issue, of the execution of
this Agreement and cooperate with East West and the trustee to facilitate East
West's assumption of the Trust Preferred Issue. East West shall take such
action as is required to assume, on or before the Effective Time, the
securities issued by Trust I.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Exercise of Warrants_. MetroCorp shall notify the holder
of the Warrant of the execution of this Agreement and take such action as
shall be necessary to effect the exercise of the Warrant if the Warrant is
exercised by the holder thereof. If the Warrant is not exercised at or prior
to the Effective Time, East West shall assume any obligations of MetroCorp
under the Warrant that survive the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
MetroCorp and East West shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any
dispositions of shares of MetroCorp Common Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to such shares) that are treated as dispositions under
such rule and result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each director or officer of MetroCorp who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to MetroCorp.

 



 

 **Article VIII 
CLOSING

 



 

Section 8.1 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place on a date and at a place to be specified by the parties, which date
shall be no later than five (5) days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be

the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

 



   



 



 

 **Article IX 
TERMINATION

 



 

Section 9.1 _Termination_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned by
action of the Board of Directors of East West or MetroCorp at any time before
the Effective Time, if:

 



 

(i) any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other
United States (federal or state) governmental body shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall be
final and nonappealable;

 



 

(ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
disapproved by any regulatory authority or other person whose approval is
required to consummate any of such transactions;

 



 

(iii) the Effective Time has not occurred on or before March 31, 2014, or
such later date as has been approved in writing by the Boards of Directors of
East West and MetroCorp; but the right to terminate under this Section
9.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
material obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or has
resulted in, the failure of the Merger to become effective on or before such
applicable date; or

 



 

(iv) the approval of the stockholders of MetroCorp contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
required vote at the MetroCorp Special Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) at which they consider the Agreement.

 



 

(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time
by action of the MetroCorp Board if East West fails to comply with any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of East West contained herein shall be
inaccurate, which noncompliance or inaccuracy, individually or in the
aggregate, would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section
11.1 or Section 11.2 (as applicable) if occurring on the Closing Date. If the
MetroCorp Board desires to terminate this Agreement because of an alleged
breach or inaccuracy as provided in this Section 9.1(b), MetroCorp Board must
notify East West in writing of its intent to terminate stating the reason
therefor. East West will have fifteen (15) days from the receipt of such
notice to cure the alleged breach or inaccuracy.

 



 

(c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time
by action of the East West Board if (i) MetroCorp fails to comply with any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of MetroCorp contained herein shall be
inaccurate, which noncompliance or inaccuracy, individually or in the
aggregate, would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section
10.1 or Section 10.2 (as applicable) if occurring on the Closing Date, or (ii)
any approval required to be obtained from any regulatory authority or agency
is obtained subject to restrictions or conditions on the operations of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, which would (i) reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries or (ii) materially reduce the economic
benefits of the Merger to East West. If the East West Board desires to
terminate this Agreement because of an alleged breach or inaccuracy as
provided in Section 9.1(c)(i), the East West Board must notify MetroCorp in
writing of its intent to terminate stating the cause therefor. MetroCorp will
have fifteen (15) days from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged
breach or inaccuracy.

 



 

 



   



 



 

(d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing upon
the mutual written consent of East West and MetroCorp and the approval of such
action by their respective Boards of Directors.

 



 

(e) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing by
MetroCorp Board if before the Effective Time, MetroCorp receives an
unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(d)) and
MetroCorp Board determines in its good faith judgment and in the exercise of
its fiduciary duties, based on the advice of outside legal counsel and the
Financial Advisor, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal (if consummated pursuant
to its terms and after giving effect to the payment of the Termination Fee and
East West Expenses (each as defined in Section 9.3(a)(i)) is a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(f)) and (ii) the failure to terminate this
Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
proper exercise of such fiduciary duties, _provided_ , _however_ , that
MetroCorp may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) unless:

 



 

(i) MetroCorp has provided prior written notice to East West at least five
(5) business days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice advises East West that MetroCorp Board has received a Superior
Proposal, specifies the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the Person or "Group" (as such term is
defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) making the Superior
Proposal); and

 



 

(ii) during the Notice Period, MetroCorp negotiates, and causes the
Financial Advisor and outside counsel to negotiate, with East West in good
faith (to the extent East West desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and MetroCorp
Board considers such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
resulting from such negotiations and concludes in good faith based upon
consultations with the Financial Advisor and the advice of outside legal
counsel that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal even after
giving effect to the adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by East West.

 



 

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
and MetroCorp Board in its good faith judgment determines such revisions are
material, MetroCorp shall deliver a new written notice to East West and shall
comply with the requirements of this Section 9.1(e) with respect to such new
written notice, except that the new Notice Period shall be three (3) business
days. Termination under this clause (e) shall not be deemed effective until
payment of the Termination Fee and/or East West Expenses as required by
Section 9.3.

 



 

 



   



 



 

(f) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing by the
East West Board if (i) MetroCorp has breached the covenant contained in
Section 5.5 in a manner adverse to East West; (ii) MetroCorp Board resolves to
accept an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) MetroCorp Board withdraws or
modifies, in any manner that is adverse to East West, its recommendation or
approval of this Agreement or the Merger or recommends to MetroCorp
stockholders acceptance or approval of any alternative Acquisition Proposal,
or resolves to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in Section
9.3, if this Agreement is terminated by either East West or MetroCorp as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement (other than Section 7.2) will become
void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its
directors, officers or stockholders, except that the provisions of Sections
7.2, 9.2 and 13.4 will survive termination of this Agreement. Nothing
contained in this Section 9.2 will relieve any party hereto of any liability
for a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Termination Fee and Expenses_. To compensate East West
for entering into this Agreement, taking actions to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder and incurring the costs and expenses
related thereto and other losses and expenses, including forgoing the pursuit
of other opportunities by East West, MetroCorp and East West agree as follows:

 



 

(a) Provided that East West is not in material breach of any covenant or
obligation under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured within
fifteen (15) days following receipt of written notice thereof by MetroCorp
specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such alleged breach), if this
Agreement is terminated by:

 



 

(i) MetroCorp under the provisions of Section 9.1(e), then MetroCorp shall
pay to East West an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the Merger
Consideration (the " _Termination Fee_ ") plus all expenses incurred by East
West in connection with the proposed transaction, _provided_ that the
aggregate amount of all such expenses shall not exceed $250,000 (" _East West
Expenses_ ");

 



 

(ii) East West under the provisions of Section 9.1(f), then MetroCorp
shall pay to East West the Termination Fee plus the East West Expenses;

 



 

(iii) either East West or MetroCorp under the provisions of (A) Section
9.1(a)(iii), if at the time of termination, the Registration Statement has
been declared effective for at least 25 business days prior to such
termination and MetroCorp shall have failed to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the MetroCorp Special Meeting in accordance with Section 5.1, or (B)
Section 9.1(a)(iv), if, at the time of termination, there exists an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to MetroCorp, then MetroCorp shall pay to
East West the East West Expenses; or

 



 

(iv) either East West or MetroCorp under the provisions of (A) Section
9.1(a)(iii), if at such time the stockholders of MetroCorp have not approved
and adopted the Agreement and the Merger, or (B) Section 9.1(a)(iv), if, at
the time of termination, there exists an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
MetroCorp and, with respect to either clause (A) or (B), within twelve (12)
months of the termination of this Agreement, MetroCorp enters into an
Acquisition Agreement with any third party with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, then MetroCorp shall pay to East West the Termination Fee, which
shall be in addition to the East West Expenses to be paid pursuant to Section
9.3(a)(iii).

 



 

 



   



 



 

The payment of the Termination Fee and/or East West Expenses shall be East
West's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to termination of this Agreement
as set forth in this Section 9.3(a). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Termination Fee described in this Section 9.3 be payable on more
than one occasion.

 



 

(b) Any payment required by Section 9.3(a) shall become payable within two
(2) business days after receipt by the nonterminating party of written notice
of termination of this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that if the payment
of the Termination Fee is required pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(iv), then such
payment shall become payable on or before the date of execution by MetroCorp
of an Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ " means
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or any similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
proposal (whether communicated to MetroCorp or publicly announced to
MetroCorp's stockholders) by any person (other than East West or any of its
Affiliates) for an Acquisition Transaction involving MetroCorp, any Subsidiary

of which constitute, or would constitute, twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of MetroCorp as reflected on MetroCorp's most recent
consolidated statement of condition prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means
any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) involving (i) any acquisition or purchase from
MetroCorp by any person or "Group" (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)
under the Exchange Act), other than East West or any of its Affiliates, of
twenty percent (20%) or more in interest of the total outstanding voting
securities of MetroCorp or any of its Subsidiaries, or any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or Group (other
than East West or any of its Affiliates) beneficially owning twenty percent
(20%) or more in interest of the total outstanding voting securities of
MetroCorp or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving MetroCorp pursuant to which the
stockholders of MetroCorp immediately preceding such transaction hold less
than eighty percent (80%) of the equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity (which includes the parent corporation of any constituent
corporation to any such transaction) of such transaction; (ii) any sale or
lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), or exchange, transfer,
license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of MetroCorp
reasonably determines, in its good faith judgment based on, among other
things, the advice of outside counsel and the Financial Advisor, to be (i)
more favorable from a financial point of view to MetroCorp's stockholders than
the Merger, taking into account all terms and conditions of the proposal and
(ii) reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory (including the advice of outside
counsel regarding the potential for regulatory approval of any such proposal)
and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted
under applicable law, provided that, for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" and "80%" in the definitions of
Acquisition Proposal and Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be
references to "50%."

(a) East West shall have received all Required Regulatory Approvals, or
waiver of such approvals, for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Bank Mergers, from all necessary regulatory agencies and
authorities, which approvals shall not impose any restrictions on the
operations of East West or the Surviving Corporation, which would (i)
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or (ii) materially reduce the
economic benefits of the Merger to East West.

 



 

(b) Any statutory or regulatory waiting period necessary to effect the
Merger, the Bank Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have
expired.

 



 

(c) Such approvals and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have
been contested by any federal or state governmental authority or any third
party (except stockholders asserting dissenters' rights) by formal proceeding.

East West or MetroCorp may, but shall not be obligated to, answer and defend
such contest or otherwise pursue the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby over such objection.

effect that, based on the terms of this Agreement and on the basis of certain
facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. In
rendering such opinion, such counsel may require and rely upon and may
incorporate by reference representations and covenants, including those
contained in certificates of officers or directors of MetroCorp, East West and
others.

Common Shares to be issued in the Merger shall have been received.

without regard to California statutes or judicial decisions regarding choice
of law questions. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of California and the federal courts of the United
States of America located in the Southern District of the State of California
solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the transactions contemplated herein and therein, and hereby waive,
and agree to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such documents, that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in
such California state or federal court. The parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the

parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
