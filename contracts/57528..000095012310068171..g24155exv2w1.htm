 This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is entered into as of July 21, 2010, by LANCE, INC., a North Carolina corporation ("Lance"), LIMA MERGER CORP., a Pennsylvania corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Lance ("Merger Sub"), and SNYDERS OF HANOVER, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Snyders"). 

  

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Snyders, Lance and Merger Sub have adopted this Agreement and have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Snyders (the "Merger"), with Snyders as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Company"); 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to, and simultaneously with, the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders of Snyders are entering into agreements with Lance in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (the "Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to and simultaneously with, the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders of Snyders are entering into an agreement with Lance in the form attached as  _Exhibit B_ (the Standstill Agreement") pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, not to acquire any additional Lance Shares for a specified period of time from and after the date hereof; 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations; 

  

 WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to be a plan of merger pursuant to Section 1922 of the PBCL (as hereinafter defined); 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended, 15 Pa. C.S.A. 1101, et seq. (the "PBCL") at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Snyders. Snyders shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. 

  

 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of KandL Gates LLP, 214 N. Tryon Street, 47th Floor, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on the date that is as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the second (2nd) Business Day) following the satisfaction or (subject to applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), unless this Agreement has been previously terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties (the actual time and date of the Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). 

  

 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Parties shall (a) file articles of merger, in customary form (the "Articles of Merger") with the Pennsylvania Department of State (the "PDOS"), and (b) duly make all other filings and recordings required by the PBCL in order to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with the PDOS or at such later time as may be agreed to by Lance and Snyders in writing and specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and time that the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the "Effective Time"). 

  

 1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1929 of the PBCL. 

  

 1.5 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Snyders shall be amended and restated so that they are identical to the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law), except that Article I of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company will read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Snyders of Hanover, Inc." At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Snyders shall be amended and restated so that they are identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law) except that the name of the corporation reflected therein shall be changed to "Snyders of Hanover, Inc." until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 1.6 Directors and Officers; Corporate Governance; Name. As of the Effective Time, and continuing for the period specified in _Exhibit C_, the members of the board of directors of Lance and each committee of the board of directors of Lance and each of the officers of Lance shall be determined as set forth on _Exhibit C_. In addition, certain other agreements of Lance, Merger Sub and Snyders with respect to the corporate governance and affairs of Lance are set 

   ##### 

  

    

forth on _Exhibit C_. As of the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of Lance shall be amended to change the name of the
corporation to Snyders-Lance, Inc. and the headquarters of the business
shall be based in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

  

 1.7 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations. 

  

 1.8 Effect on Capital Stock. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company. 

  

 (b) Each Snyders Share that is held by Snyders as treasury stock or is otherwise owned by Snyders or any Snyders Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) Subject to Sections 1.8(b) and 2.9, each Snyders Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 108.25 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable Lance Shares (the "Merger Consideration"). All such Snyders Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Snyders Shares (each, a "Certificate") and each holder of Snyders Shares held in book-entry form shall, in each case, cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Lance Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Snyders Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.5. 

  

 (d) Lance shall reserve and take all other action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of Lance Shares for delivery in accordance with this Section 1.8. Prior to the Effective Time, Lance shall prepare and file with the SEC a Form S-4 (or file such other appropriate form) registering a number of Lance Shares deemed necessary by Lance to fulfill Lances obligations under this Section 1.8. 

  

 1.9 Stock Options; Executive Stock Purchase Program. 

  

 (a) The terms of each outstanding option to purchase Snyders Shares under any employee stock option compensation plans or similar arrangement of Snyders (a "Snyders Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, on the Closing Date, each Snyders Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall be deemed to constitute an option (an "Adjusted Option") to acquire, on similar 

   ##### 

  

    

terms and conditions as were applicable under such Snyders Stock Option, the
number of whole Lance Shares that is equal to the number of Snyders Shares
subject to such Snyders Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at
an exercise price per Lance Share equal to the exercise price for each such
Snyders Share subject to such Snyders Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole
penny), and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as applied to each
such Snyders Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, that the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to each
such so adjusted option and the terms and conditions of exercise of each such
so adjusted option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 409A
of the Code and for any Snyders Stock Options to which Section 421 of
the Code applies by reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422
through 424 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares purchasable
pursuant to each such so adjusted option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of each such so adjusted option shall be determined in order
to comply with Section 424 of the Code. 

  

 (b) Lance shall reserve and take all other action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of Lance Shares for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options in accordance with this Section 1.9. Promptly after the Effective Time, if and to the extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of Lance Shares to be registered and issuable under the Adjusted Options, Lance shall prepare and file with the SEC a post-effective amendment converting the Form S-4 to a Form S-8 (or file such other appropriate form) registering a number of Lance Shares deemed necessary by Lance to fulfill Lances obligations under this Section 1.9. 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, Lance shall assume the obligations and succeed to the rights of Snyders under Snyders employee stock option compensation plans or similar arrangements (the "Snyders Stock Plans") with respect to the Snyders Stock Options (as converted into Adjusted Options). Snyders and Lance agree that prior to the Effective Time each of the Snyders Stock Plans shall be amended (i) to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the conversion of the Snyders Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.9(a) above and the substitution of Lance for Snyders thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such Snyders Stock Plan; (ii) to preclude any automatic or formulaic grant of options, restricted shares or other awards thereunder on or after the Effective Time; and (iii) to the extent requested by Lance and subject to compliance with applicable Law and the terms of the plan, to terminate any or all Snyders Stock Plans effective immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than with respect to outstanding awards thereunder). From and after the Effective Time, all references to Snyders in each Snyders Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of Snyders Stock Options shall be deemed to refer to Lance, unless Lance in good faith determines otherwise.

ARTICLE II 
 DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 

   

 2.1 Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Lance shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Snyders, or Lances transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the "Exchange Agent Agreement") to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") hereunder. 

  

 2.2 Deposit of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Lance shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Snyders Shares to be converted in the Merger (including the Dissenting Share Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.6)), for exchange, in accordance with this Article II and through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and Lance Shares to make all deliveries pursuant to this Article II; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Exchange Fund (as defined below) shall for any reason not include sufficient cash or Lance Shares to make all such deliveries, upon notice thereof from the Exchange Agent to Lance, Lance shall from time to time promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent sufficient cash and Lance Shares to make all such deliveries. Any cash or Lance Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be collectively referred to as the "Exchange Fund". 

  

 2.3 Letter of Transmittal. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Snyders Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 and any cash in lieu of fractional Lance Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon actual delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the "Letter of Transmittal")) and (b) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Lance Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II. 

  

 2.4 Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Snyders Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Lance Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the Snyders Shares represented by its Certificate or Certificates and the person surrendering such Certificate or Certificates shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the surrender or establish to the satisfaction of Lance that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Lance Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Snyders Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Snyders, the fractional Lance Shares 

   ##### 

  

    

and cash in lieu of fractional Lance Shares comprising the
Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Snyders Shares
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Lance that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 2.5 Treatment of Unexchanged Certificates and Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Lance Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Lance Shares represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (a) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to whole Lance Shares represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to Lance Shares represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Lance Shares issuable with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 2.6 Dissenters Rights. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Snyders Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has complied with all of the relevant provisions of Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL (each, a "Dissenting Snyders Stockholder") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders of such Snyders Shares (the "Dissenting Snyders Shares") shall thereafter be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 1930(a) and the relevant provisions of Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL, unless and until such Dissenting Snyders Stockholder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his, her or its rights to dissent and demand payment of fair value for the Snyders Shares under the PBCL (any of the foregoing, a "Dissent Failure"). Snyders shall give Lance prompt written notice of any notices of intention to dissent and demand payment of fair value for Snyders Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the PBCL relating to dissenters rights, and Lance shall have the right to participate in and direct, together with Snyders, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for payment of fair value under the PBCL. Snyders shall not, without the prior written consent of Lance (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 (b) The Lance Shares that each Dissenting Snyders Stockholder would, in the absence of his, her or its dissent, have been entitled to receive under Section 2.4 (collectively, the "Dissenting Share Merger Consideration") shall be held by the Exchange Agent pending a final resolution of the underlying dissent, and released as follows: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) upon a Dissent Failure with respect to such Dissenting Snyders Shares, all such Dissenting Snyders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive the Dissenting Share Merger Consideration held by the Exchange Agent with respect thereto upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of the Certificate(s) representing such Snyders Shares accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with Section 2.4; and 

   

 (ii) upon payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Snyders Shares, as determined pursuant to the relevant provisions of Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL, or as agreed between Snyders and such Dissenting Snyders Stockholder with respect to such Dissenting Snyders Shares (subject to Lances prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Dissenting Share Merger Consideration held by the Exchange Agent with respect to such Dissenting Snyders Shares shall be returned to Lance. 

  

 2.7 Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent (or subsequent to the earlier of (a) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (b) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Lance) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Snyders Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Lance, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Lance, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Snyders Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Lance, as the case may be. 

  

 2.8 Stock Transfer Books. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Snyders of the Snyders Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Snyders Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Lance Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. 

  

 2.9 No Fractional Shares. No fractional Lance Shares shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Lance Shares shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Lance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each holder of Snyders Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional Lance Share (after taking into account all Snyders Shares owned by such Person) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of Lance Shares on NASDAQ (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Lance and Snyders) on the last complete trading day prior to the Effective Time. The Parties acknowledge that payment of cash in lieu of issuing 

   ##### 

  

    

fractional shares is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately
bargained-for consideration. 

  

 2.10 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Snyders as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be paid to Lance. In such event, any former shareholders of Snyders who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Lance with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Lance Shares deliverable in respect of each Lance Share such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Lance, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Snyders Shares for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Snyders Shares as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 to pay Dissenting Share Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.6(b)(i) that is not paid in respect of Dissenting Snyders Shares shall be returned to Lance in accordance with Section 2.6(b)(ii). 

  

 2.11 Lost Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Lance or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Lance may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 2.12 Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Lance. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Lance. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Lance shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

  

 2.13 No Liability. None of Lance, Merger Sub, Snyders, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Snyders have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on its part. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Snyders, enforceable against Snyders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 3.4 No Conflicts. Except as set forth on Section 3.4 of the Snyders Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the performance of the Transactions will, directly or indirectly, with or without notice or lapse of time: (a) violate any Law to which any Snyders Company or any asset owned or used by any Snyders Company is subject; (b) violate any Permit of any Snyders Company or give any Governmental Body the right to terminate, revoke, suspend or modify any Permit of any Snyders Company; (c) violate any Organizational Document of any Snyders Company; (d) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, result in the acceleration of or give any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or to cancel, terminate, modify or exercise any remedy under, any Contract to which any Snyders Company is a party or by which any Snyders Company is bound or to which any asset of any Snyders Company is subject or under which any Snyders Company has any rights or the performance of which is guaranteed by any Snyders Company; (e) cause Lance or any Snyders Company to have any material Liability for any Tax; or (f) result in the imposition of any Encumbrance upon any asset owned or used by any Snyders Company.

The Snyders Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby, and present fairly the financial condition of the Snyders Companies as of and for their respective dates;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the interim financial statements described in clause (ii) above are subject to normal, recurring year-end adjustments (which will not be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse), lack notes (which, if presented, would not differ materially from the notes accompanying the Balance Sheet) and do not reflect Snyders full first interim period. 

  

 (b) Each Snyders Companys books and records (including all financial records, business records, customer lists, and records pertaining to products or services delivered to customers) (i) are complete and correct in all material respects and all transactions to which such Snyders Company is or has been a party are accurately reflected therein in all material respects

 (c) Each Snyders Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). This internal control over financial reporting is effective in all material respects and has been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and is effective in performing the functions for which it was established. Except as set forth in Section 3.5 of the Snyders Disclosure Letter, with respect to the fiscal years covered by the Snyders Financial Statements, no Snyders Company has had (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting, (ii) any changes in the internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, such internal control over financial reporting or (iii) any events of fraud, whether or not material, that involve management or other employees of any Snyders Company who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting.

   ##### 

  

  

 3.11 Real Property. 

  

 (a) Section 3.11(a) of the Snyders Disclosure Letter lists all of the real property and interests therein owned by any Snyders Company (with all easements and other rights appurtenant to such property, the "Snyders Owned Real Property") and, relative to each such property or interest, the Snyders Company that owns it. Except as set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Snyders Disclosure Letter, the Snyders Companies have good and marketable fee simple title to the Snyders Owned Real Property, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Snyders Disclosure Letter, no Snyders Company is a lessor of any parcel of Snyders Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein. 

  

 (b) Section 3.11(b) of the Snyders Disclosure Letter lists all of the real property and interests therein leased, subleased or otherwise occupied or used by any Snyders Company (with all easements and other rights appurtenant to such property, the "Snyders Leased Real Property").

Except as set forth in Section 3.11(b) of the Snyders Disclosure Letter, no Snyders Company is a sublessor of, or has assigned any lease covering, any item of Snyders Leased Real Property. Leasing commissions or other brokerage fees due from or payable by any Snyders Company with respect to any Snyders Lease have been paid in full. 

  

 (c) The Snyders Owned Real Property and the Snyders Leased Real Property (collectively, the "Snyders Real Property") constitute all interests in real property currently used in connection with the businesses of the Snyders Companies.

(an "ERISA Affiliate") that would be subject to any Liability that,

   ##### 

  

    

the period for obtaining such a determination letter has not yet closed, and,
to the Knowledge of any Snyders Company, there are no facts, circumstances
or events since the date of such determination letter that could reasonably

 (b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that any Snyders Company or any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has maintained or to which any of them contributes, has contributed, or has been required to contribute or had any Liability: 

   

 (i) Neither a Snyders Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any Liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971 of the Code that has not been satisfied. No Employee Benefit Plan has within the three years preceding the date of this Agreement, incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor is there any request pending before the IRS for any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, nor has there been any prior such request granted with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan where the minimum funding commitment has not yet been 

   ##### 

  

    

satisfied, nor has any Lien in favor of any Employee Benefit Plan arisen under
Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA. Neither a Snyders
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has been required to provide security to any
defined benefit pension plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code that
has not been released. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the
Code, (i) the fair market value of the assets of such Employee Benefit Plan
equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under
such Employee Benefit Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the actuarial
assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial report for such
Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) there has been no partial termination of any such
Employee Benefit Plan, and (iii) none of the following events has occurred:
(x) the filing of a notice of intent to terminate, (y) the treatment of
an Employee Benefit Plan amendment as a termination under Section 4041 of
ERISA or (z) the commencement of proceedings by the PBGC to terminate an
Employee Benefit Plan. There has been no "reportable event" within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations
thereunder which required a notice to the PBGC which has not been fully and
accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not
reported, would constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute involuntary
termination proceedings with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA. 

   

 (ii) No Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a multiple employer plan. No Snyders Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has (i) contributed to or been obligated to contribute to, at any time during the last six years, any Multiemployer Plan or multiple employer plan, (ii) withdrawn in a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or multiple employer plan or (iii) incurred any liability due to the termination or reorganization of a Multiemployer Plan or a multiple employer plan. 

   

 (iii) Since January 1, 2005, there has been no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan. No "fiduciary" (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) has any Liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan that could subject Snyders Company or any officer of Snyders Company to any material Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or to any material liability under Sections 502(i) or (l) of ERISA. No Proceeding with respect to the administration or the investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of any Snyders Company, threatened or anticipated. To the Knowledge of any Snyders Company, there is no basis for any such Proceeding. There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of any Snyders Company, threatened or anticipated claims with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan other than routine claims for benefits. 

  

 (c) Except as set forth on Section 3.19(a)(iii) of the Snyders Disclosure Letter, no Snyders Company maintains or has maintained or contributes, has contributed, has been required to contribute, or as a result of the Transactions will be required to contribute to any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan providing medical, health, or life insurance or other welfare-type

to, any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax. 

   

 (b) Each Lance Company has withheld or collected, and timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, all Taxes required to have been withheld or collected and remitted, and complied with all information reporting and back-up withholding requirements, and has maintained all required records with respect thereto, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, customer, creditor, stockholder, independent contractor, or other third party. 

  

 (c) The unpaid Taxes of the Lance Companies (i) did not, as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Liability for Taxes (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Lance Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Lance Companies in filing their Tax Returns. 

  

 (d) There is no dispute or claim concerning any Liability for Taxes paid, collected or remitted (or to be paid, collected or permitted) by any Lance Company either (i) claimed or raised by any Governmental Body in writing or (ii) as to which any Lance Company has Knowledge. No Lance Company has waived any statute or period of limitations with respect to any Tax or agreed, or been requested by any Governmental Body to agree, to any extension of time with respect to any Tax. No extension of time within which to file any Tax Return of any Lance Company has been requested, granted or currently is in effect. 

  

 (e) No Lance Company has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to make any payments that will not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law). No Lance Company is a party to any Tax allocation, sharing, reimbursement or similar agreement. No Lance Company has been a member of any Affiliated Group filing a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was Lance). No Lance Company has any Liability for Taxes of any Person (other than any Lance Company) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulation (or any similar provision of any other Law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or otherwise. No Lance Company has distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Sections 355 or 361 of the Code. No Lance Company has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Lance will not be required to deduct and withhold any amount under Section 1445(a) of the Code or otherwise upon the transfer of the Shares to Lance. 

  

 (f) Section 4.14 of the Lance Disclosure Letter lists each agreement, contract, plan or other arrangement (whether or not written and whether or not an Employee Benefit Plan) to 

   ##### 

  

 

which any Lance Company is a party that is a "nonqualified deferred

 4.19 Employee Benefits. 

  

 (a) Section 4.19 of the Lance Disclosure Letter lists each Employee Benefit Plan that any Lance Company, since January 1, 2009, maintains or to which any Lance Company contributes, has any obligation to contribute or has any other Liability. 

   

 (i) Each such Employee Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract, or fund) complies in form and in operation in all material respects with all applicable laws and the terms of each such plan. The terms of each Employee Benefit Plan are in material compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which any Lance Company or any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with any Lance Company, would be deemed to be an ERISA Affiliate that would be subject to any Liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (ii) All required reports and descriptions (including Form 5500 Annual Reports, summary annual reports, PBGC-1s and summary plan descriptions) have been timely filed and distributed appropriately with respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan. 

   

 (iii) With respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan: (A) the Lance Company has no material liability on account of any violation of the requirements of COBRA, (B) the Lance Company has no material liability on account of any violation of the health care requirements of Part 7 of Title I of ERISA or Sections 9801, 9802, 9803, 9811, 9812 of the Code. Neither the Lance Company, any Employee Benefit Plan or any employee, administrator or agent thereof is or has been in violation of the transaction and code set rules under Sections 1172-1175 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended ("HIPAA"), the HIPAA privacy rules under 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164 or the HIPAA security rules under 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and C of Part 164\.

   ##### 

  

    

Company after their termination of employment, except as specifically required
by COBRA or applicable state law. 

   

 (iv) There are no material outstanding Liabilities of, or related to, any Employee Benefit Plan, other than Liabilities for benefits to be paid in the ordinary course to participants in such Employee Benefit Plan and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of such Employee Benefit Plans. No "excess contributions" have been made that would be non-deductible or that would subject Lance Company to the excise tax imposed under Section 4972 of the Code. 

   

 (v) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) that are due have been paid to each such Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan. All premiums or other payments required to have been made for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date have been paid with respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan. With respect to any such contributions, premiums or other payments required that are not yet due, to the extent required by GAAP, adequate reserves are reflected on the Lance Balance Sheet or Liability therefore was incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the Balance Sheet Date. 

   

 (vi) Each such Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan meets the requirements of a "qualified plan" under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is such a "qualified plan," or the period for obtaining such a determination letter has not yet closed, and, to the Knowledge of any Lance Company, there are no facts, circumstances or events since the date of such determination letter that could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such determination letter. The trust, if any, forming part of each Employee Pension Benefit Plan is exempt from U.S. federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. 

   

 (vii) No Lance Company has any commitment, intention or understanding to modify, adopt or approve any new, Employee Benefit Plan, or terminate any such Employee Benefit Plan. 

   

 (viii) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of Transaction Documents nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (whether alone or in connection with any other events(s)) will, except as set forth on Section 4.19(a)(viii) of the Lance Disclosure Letter, (A) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase benefits or the amount payable under any Employee Benefit Plan, (B) result in payments under any of the Employee Benefit Plans that (1) would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code, or (2) would result in any excise tax on any Employee under Section 4999 of the Code or any other comparable Law, or (C) result in any material limitation on the right of any Lance Company or its successors to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust.

in respect of any such Employee Benefit Plan, (I) all related trust
agreements, service provider agreements, insurance contracts, agreements with
investment managers and other funding agreements that implement each such
Employee Benefit Plan and (J) all amendments, modifications or supplements to
any such document. 

  

 (b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that any Lance Company or any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has maintained or to which any of them contributes, has contributed, or has been required to contribute or had any Liability: 

   

 (i) Neither a Lance Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any Liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971 of the Code that has not been satisfied. No Employee Benefit Plan has within the three years preceding the date of this Agreement, incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor is there any request pending before the IRS for any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, nor has there been any prior such request granted with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan where the minimum funding commitment has not yet been satisfied, nor has any Lien in favor of any Employee Benefit Plan arisen under Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA. Neither a Lance Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has been required to provide security to any defined benefit pension plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code that has not been released. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) the fair market value of the assets of such Employee Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such Employee Benefit Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial report for such Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) there has been no partial termination of any such Employee Benefit Plan, and (iii) none of the following events has occurred: (x) the filing of a notice of intent to terminate, (y) the treatment of an Employee Benefit Plan amendment as a termination under Section 4041 of ERISA or (z) the commencement of proceedings by the PBGC to terminate an Employee Benefit Plan. There has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations thereunder which required a notice to the PBGC which has not been fully and accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute involuntary termination proceedings with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. 

   

 (ii) No Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a multiple employer plan. No Lance Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has (i) contributed to or been obligated to contribute to, at any time during the last six years, any Multiemployer Plan or multiple employer plan, (ii) withdrawn in a complete or partial 

   ##### 

  

    

withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or multiple employer plan or (iii)
incurred any liability due to the termination or reorganization of a
Multiemployer Plan or a multiple employer plan. 

   

 (iii) Since January 1, 2005, there has been no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan. No "fiduciary" (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) has any Liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan that could subject Lance Company or any officer of Lance Company to any material Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or to any material liability under Sections 502(i) or (l) of ERISA. No Proceeding with respect to the administration or the investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of any Lance Company, threatened or anticipated. To the Knowledge of any Lance Company, there is no basis for any such Proceeding. There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of any Lance Company, threatened or anticipated claims with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan other than routine claims for benefits. 

  

 (c) No Lance Company maintains or has maintained or contributes, has contributed, has been required to contribute, or as a result of the Transactions will be required to contribute to any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan providing medical, health, or life insurance or other welfare-type benefits for current or future retired or terminated employees, their spouses or their dependents (other than in accordance with COBRA).

Party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information or where such properties or information is subject
to the attorney-client privilege (it being understood that the participation
and cooperation contemplated herein is not intended to constitute, nor
shall be deemed to constitute, any form of direct or indirect waiver of the
attorney-client privilege maintained by any party hereto). Each of Snyders
and Lance will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
other regulatory authorities under this Section 5.4 to comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of Law and the rules and

 (a) Snyders agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Snyders Acquisition Proposal. Snyders will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Lance with respect to any Snyders Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to a Snyders Acquisition Proposal. Snyders will promptly (and in any event, within two Business Days) advise Lance following receipt of any Snyders Acquisition Proposal (or any indication by any Person that it is considering making a Snyders Acquisition Proposal) and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Snyders Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Lance apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Snyders Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement

to or reasonably likely to lead to, any Snyders Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) resolve, agree or propose to take any of such actions. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Snyders Stockholder

 (a) Lance agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Lance Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the event Lance receives an unsolicited Lance Acquisition Proposal and the board of directors of Lance concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Lance Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, Lance may, and may permit its Representatives, its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the board of directors of Lance concludes in good faith (and based on the advice of counsel) that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, and it shall simultaneously provide Snyders with any such nonpublic information to the extent it has not previously provided such information to Snyders. Lance will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Snyders with respect to any Lance Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to a Lance Acquisition Proposal.

 (b) The Lance board of directors shall not: (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Snyders) the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of this Agreement and the Transactions, (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Lance Acquisition Proposal or (C) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each such action, a "Lance Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) cause or permit Lance to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

constituting or related to, or which is intended to or reasonably likely to
lead to, any Lance Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve, agree or propose to
take any of such actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Lance Stockholder Approval, the Lance board of directors may
make a Lance Adverse Recommendation Change if it determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

   

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Lance or its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a Lance Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 

  

 5.7 Snyders Stockholder Approval. As of the date of this Agreement, the board of directors of Snyders has adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and the Transactions on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and directing that this Agreement and the Transactions, on such terms and conditions, be submitted to Snyders stockholders for their consideration.

Neither Snyders nor Lance, nor any of their Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such Party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Lance, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Snyders or shall give Snyders, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Lance, prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, each of Lance and Snyders shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 (a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2010, the employees of Snyders and its Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of Lance or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and any Subsidiary thereof) (the "Continuing Employees") shall receive 

   ##### 

   

    

compensation and benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation and benefits provided to such employees of Snyders and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Lance or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits including benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under defined benefit plans) and vesting service recognized by Snyders and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Lance or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. 

  

 (c) With respect to any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan maintained by Lance or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Lance or such Lance Subsidiary shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of Snyders and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket maximums incurred prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and Snyders shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Lance to continue any specific plans or to continue the employment of any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Lance to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Lance or Snyders. Without limiting the scope of Section 8.3, nothing in this Section 5.12 shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any Continuing Employee or any other person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 5.13 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, Lance shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Lance shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director, officer and employee of Snyders and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, including the Transactions. 

  

 (b) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Closing Date, Lance shall maintain in effect the Snyders Companies current directors and officers liability 

   ##### 

  

    

insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date with
respect to those Persons who are currently covered by the Snyders Companies
directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Snyders Companies
directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that Lance may substitute
therefor policies of a reputable insurance company the terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and
officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section
5.13(b); _provided_ , _further_ , that Lance shall not be required to pay
an annual premium for such directors and officers liability insurance in
excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Snyders Companies
for such insurance, and if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Lance shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lance may fulfill its obligation to provide
insurance under this Section 5.13(b) by obtaining a "tail" policy of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in
the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than the existing policy, and
maintaining such "tail" policy in full force and effect for a period of at
least six (6) years. 

  

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 5.13(a), upon learning of any Proceeding, will promptly notify Lance; _provided_ , that the failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of Lance under Section 5.13(a) unless and to the extent that Lance is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence. 

  

 (d) If Lance or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Lance will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Lance will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.13 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 5.14 Notice of Developments. Each Party shall give written notice to the others of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of which it has Knowledge that causes or would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, (b) the failure by such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder, (c) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions and (d) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental Body in connection with the Transactions. Except as provided below, no such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of such Party or the conditions to its respective obligations hereunder. Solely to the extent such notification under clause (a) above relates to an event, condition, fact or circumstance that arises after the date of this Agreement, each of Lance and Snyders shall be entitled to make such notification in the form of updates and/or modifications to the Lance Disclosure Letter or Snyders Disclosure Letter, as applicable (each, an "Update"), and such Update shall amend and supplement the appropriate sections of such 

   ##### 

  

    

Disclosure Letter previously delivered by such Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless Lance, in the
case of an Update by Snyders, or Snyders, in the case of an Update by Lance,
provides the other Parties with a written notice of termination pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(d)(ii), as applicable, within three (3) Business
Days after the expiration of any applicable cure period in respect of
a breach described in an Update delivered pursuant to this Section 5.14, and
which uncured breach would otherwise give rise to a termination right by such
Party under Section 7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(d)(ii), as applicable, then the Party
receiving such an Update shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate
this Agreement or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, and to have
accepted such Update for all purposes under this Agreement. Subject to the
termination right described above, the delivery of any such Update shall be
deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of warranty
that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such variance or
inaccuracy. 

  

 5.15 Confidentiality, Press Releases and Public Announcements. The Parties acknowledge that any information provided to, or otherwise acquired by, it in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transactions without obtaining the prior written approval of the other Parties, unless, in the sole judgment of such Party, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Lance lists securities; _provided_ , that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other Parties with respect to the timing and content thereof. Snyders and Lance will consult with each other concerning the means by which any employee, customer or supplier of Snyders or Lance (including any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any other Person having any business relationship with any Snyders or Lance (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) will be informed of the Transactions, and the other Party will have the right to be present for any such communication. 

  

 5.16 Takeover Statutes. If any "control share acquisition", "fair price", "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to Snyders, Lance, Merger Sub, the Merger or any Transaction, then each of Snyders, Lance, Merger Sub and their respective board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing. Each of the Parties shall take no action to cause any such anti-takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.17 Tax-Free Reorganization. Lance, Merger Sub and Snyders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

If the Closing shall occur prior to November 15, 2010, the holders of Snyders Shares shall not be eligible to receive the Snyders Third Quarter Dividend but, so long as they hold Lance Shares as of November 15, 2010, shall be eligible to receive the aforementioned Lance fourth quarter dividend. 

  

 5.20 Snyders Initial Public Offering. From the date hereof until the date of the Snyders stockholder meeting to obtain Snyders Stockholder Approval, Snyders shall not (i) substantially prepare to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-1 for shares of Snyders common stock to be issued in an initial public offering of Snyders common stock (a "Snyders IPO"), (ii) prepare or file with a national or international securities exchange a listing application for shares of Snyders common stock to be issued in a Snyders IPO, or (iii) prepare or enter into any agreements with underwriters with respect to a Snyders IPO.

If holders of more than 3% of the outstanding Snyders Shares as of the Closing are Dissenting Snyders Shares, to the extent the presence of such Dissenting Snyders Shares would result in a change in the material economic arrangements contemplated by the Parties and reflected in this Agreement, the Parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith, together with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, in order to evaluate and identify a resolution reasonably acceptable to all Parties that preserves such material economic arrangements.

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Lance pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i); or

date), in the case of a Snyders Termination Fee that becomes payable

The failure of a Party at any time to require performance of any provision of this Agreement will not affect such Partys rights at a later time to enforce such provision. No waiver by any Party of any breach of this Agreement will be deemed to extend to any other breach hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any other breach. 

  

 8.12 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, provided that the remainder of the Agreement, absent the excised portion, can be reasonably interpreted to give the effect to the intentions of Lance and Snyders, or be construed to be invalid or unenforceable provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. 

  

 8.13 Construction. The article and section headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and are not intended to affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

successor provisions thereto and all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, in each case as in effect as of the date hereof and the Closing

require. References in this Agreement to time periods in terms of a certain

representation and warranty will be given independent significance of fact
and will not be deemed superseded or modified by any other
such representation or warranty. 

  

 8.14 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably and would have no adequate remedy of law if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise is breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Parties will be entitled to an injunction to prevent any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to enforce specifically any provision of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled and without having to prove the inadequacy of any other remedy they may have at law or in equity and without being required to post bond or other security.
