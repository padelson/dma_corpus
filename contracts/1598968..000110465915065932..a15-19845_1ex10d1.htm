agrees that it

 



      
 

 



 

will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser from and against any and all

disclosed by the Partnership Entities in reports that the Partnership files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported

including controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Partnerships management, including the
principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s) of the

functions for which they were established.

General Partners principal executive officer(s) and principal financial
officer(s), to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability;

Partnership to each Purchaser in this Agreement.

conditions, reservations, encumbrances and limitations contained in the

contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, will directly or indirectly
succeed in all material respects to the Water Assets.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS**

 



 

Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, hereby represents and warrants to
the Partnership that:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Existence_. Such Purchaser is duly organized and validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with
all requisite power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
properties and to conduct its business as currently conducted, except where
the failure to have such power or authority would not prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Authorization, Enforceability_. Such Purchaser has all necessary
corporate, limited liability company or partnership power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby, and the execution, delivery and performance by such Purchaser of this
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement has been duly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of such Purchaser; and this Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of such Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 



 

Section 4.3 _No Breach_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement by such Purchaser and the
consummation by such Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby will not (a) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any
of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material
agreement to which such Purchaser is a party or by which such Purchaser is
bound or to which any of the property or assets of such Purchaser is subject,
(b) conflict with or result in any violation of the provisions of the
Organizational Documents of such Purchaser, or (c) violate any statute, order,
rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having
jurisdiction over such Purchaser or the property or assets of such Purchaser,
except in the cases of clauses (a) and (c), for such conflicts, breaches,
violations or defaults as would not prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Certain Fees_. No fees or commissions are or will be payable by
such Purchaser to brokers, finders, or investment bankers with respect to the
purchase of any of the Purchased Units or the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Such Purchaser agrees that it will indemnify
and hold harmless the Partnership from and against any and all claims,
demands, or liabilities for brokers, finders, placement, or other similar
fees or commissions incurred by such Purchaser in connection with the purchase
of the Purchased Units or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.5 _No Side Agreements_. There are no other agreements by, among or
between such Purchaser and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby other than the Operative Documents nor
promises or inducements for future transactions between or among any of such
parties.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Investment_. The Purchased Units are being acquired for such
Purchasers own account, the account of its Affiliates, or the accounts of
clients for whom such Purchaser exercises discretionary investment authority
(all of whom such Purchaser hereby represents and warrants are "accredited
investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated by
the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act), not as a nominee or agent, and
with no present intention of distributing the Purchased Units or any part
thereof, and such Purchaser has no present intention of selling or granting
any participation in or otherwise distributing the same in any transaction in
violation of the securities laws of the United States or any state, without
prejudice, however, to such Purchasers right at all times to sell or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Purchased Units under a
registration statement under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws or under an exemption from such registration available
thereunder (including, without limitation, if available, Rule 144 promulgated
thereunder). If such Purchaser should in the future decide to dispose of any
of the Purchased Units, the Purchaser understands and agrees (a) that it may
do so only in compliance with the Securities Act and applicable state
securities law, as then in effect, including a sale contemplated by any
registration statement pursuant to which such securities are being offered, or
pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act, and (b) that stop-transfer
instructions to that effect will be in effect with respect to such securities.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Nature of Purchaser_. Such Purchaser represents and warrants to,
and covenants and agrees with, the Partnership that, (a) it is an "accredited
investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated by the
Commission pursuant to the Securities Act and (b) by reason of its business
and financial experience it has such knowledge, sophistication and experience
in making similar investments and in business and financial matters generally
so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective
investment in the Purchased Units, is able to bear the economic risk of such
investment and, at the present time, would be able to afford a complete loss
of such investment.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Restricted Securities_. Such Purchaser understands that the
Purchased Units are characterized as "restricted securities" under the federal
securities Laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the Partnership in a
transaction not involving a public offering and that under such Laws and
applicable regulations such securities may not be resold absent registration
under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. In this connection, such
Purchaser represents that it is knowledgeable with respect to Rule 144 of the
Commission promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Legend_. Such Purchaser understands that the book entry
evidencing the Purchased Units will bear the legend required by the
Partnership Agreement as well as a legend substantively consistent with the
following legend: "These securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). These
securities may not be sold or offered for sale except pursuant to an effective
registration

 



      
 

 



 

statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from
registration thereunder, in each case in accordance with all applicable
securities laws of the states or other jurisdictions, and in the case of a
transaction exempt from registration, such securities may only be transferred
if the transfer agent for such securities has received documentation
satisfactory to it that such transaction does not require registration under
the Securities Act."

Company has provided or made available to such Purchaser (through EDGAR, the
Companys website or otherwise) all SEC Reports, as well as all press releases
or investor presentations issued by the Company through the date of this
Agreement that are included in a filing by the Company on Form 8-K or clearly
posted on the Companys website.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Short Selling_. Such Purchaser represents that it has not
entered into any Short Sales of the Common Units owned by it since the time it
first began discussions with the Partnership or the Placement Agent about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, subject to
such Purchasers compliance with its obligations under the U.S. federal
securities laws and its internal policies, the above shall not apply, in the
case of a Purchaser that is a large multi-unit investment or commercial
banking organization, to activities in the normal course of trading units of
such Purchaser; provided, further, that subject to such Purchasers compliance
with its obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws and its internal
policies: (a) such Purchaser, for purposes hereof, shall not be deemed to
include any employees, subsidiaries or Affiliates that are effectively walled
off by appropriate "Chinese Wall" information barriers approved by such
Purchasers legal or compliance department (and thus have not been privy to
any information concerning this transaction) (a "Walled Off Person") and (b)
the foregoing representations in this paragraph shall not apply to any
transaction by or on behalf of such Purchaser that was effected by a Walled
Off Person in the ordinary course of trading without the advice or
participation of such Purchaser or receipt of confidential or other
information regarding this transaction provided by such Purchaser to such
entity.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 **COVENANTS**

 



 

Section 5.1 _Taking of Necessary Action_. Each of the parties hereto shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts promptly to take or cause to be taken all
action and promptly to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law and regulations to consummate and make

the foregoing, the Partnership and each Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make all filings and obtain all Consents of Governmental
Authorities that may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of the other
parties, as the case may be, advisable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents. The Partnership shall
promptly and accurately respond, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its transfer agent to respond, to reasonable requests for
information (which is otherwise not publicly available) made by a Purchaser or
its auditors relating to the actual holdings of such Purchaser or its
accounts; _provided_ , that the Partnership shall not be obligated to provide
any such information that could reasonably result in a violation of applicable
Law or conflict with the Partnerships insider trading policy or a
confidentiality

 



      
 

 



 

obligation of the Partnership. The Partnership shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to reasonably cooperate with
each Purchaser to ensure that the Purchased Units are validly and effectively
issued to such Purchaser and that such Purchasers ownership of the Purchased
Units following the Closing is accurately reflected on the appropriate books
and records of the Partnerships transfer agent.

the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
Registration Rights Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, provided that any request for such payment is accompanied by a
satisfactory written invoice for such expenses. If any action at law or equity
is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of any Operative Document, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees, costs and
necessary disbursements in addition to any other relief to which such Party
may be entitled. Any legal fees of Andrews Kurth LLP in excess of $75,000
shall be paid pro rata by all the Purchasers in proportion to the number of
Purchased Units purchased by each.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Indemnification by the Partnership_. The Partnership agrees to
indemnify each Purchaser and its Representatives (collectively, " _Purchaser
Related Parties_ ") from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
actions, suits, proceedings (including any investigations, litigation or
inquiries), demands, and causes of action, and, in connection therewith, and
promptly upon demand, pay or reimburse each of them for all costs, losses,
liabilities, damages, or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all
other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
or preparing to defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or
asserted against or involve any of them as a result of, arising out of, or in
any way related to the breach of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of the Partnership contained herein, provided that such claim for
indemnification relating to a breach of the representations or warranties is
made prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representations
or warranties; and provided further, that no Purchaser Related Party shall be
entitled to recover special, consequential (including lost profits) or
punitive damages.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, consequential damages shall not be
deemed to include diminution in value of the Purchased Units, which is
specifically included in damages covered by Purchaser Related Parties
indemnification above.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Indemnification by Purchasers_. Each Purchaser agrees, severally
and not jointly, to indemnify the Partnership, the General Partner and their
respective Representatives (collectively, " _Partnership Related Parties_ ")
from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all actions, suits,
proceedings (including any investigations, litigation or inquiries), demands,
and causes of action, and, in connection therewith, and promptly upon demand,
pay or reimburse each of them for all costs, losses, liabilities, damages, or
expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all other reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to defend
any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or involve
any of them as a result of, arising out of, or in any way related to the
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of such
Purchaser contained herein, _provided_ that such claim for indemnification
relating to a breach of the representations and warranties is made prior to
the expiration of such representations and warranties; and _provided further_
, that no Partnership Related Party shall be entitled to recover special,
consequential (including lost profits or diminution in value) or punitive
damages.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Indemnification Procedure_. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party under this _Article VI_ of notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this _Article VI_,
notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of
that action; _provided, however,_ that the failure to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under
_Sections 6.1_ or _6.2_ of this _Article VI_ except to the extent it has been
materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights and
defenses) by such failure and, _provided, further,_ that the failure to notify
the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this _Article VI_. If any
such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it
shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly
with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After
notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to
assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not
be liable to the indemnified party under this _Article VI_ for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection
with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation;
_provided, however,_ that the indemnified party shall have the right to employ
counsel to represent jointly the indemnified party and those other indemnified
parties and their respective directors, officers, employees and controlling
persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this _Article VI_ if (i) the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party shall have so mutually agreed; (ii) the
indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party
and its directors, officers, employees and controlling persons shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be legal

 



      
 

 



 

defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those
available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified
parties or their respective directors, officers, employees or controlling
persons, on the one hand, and the indemnifying party, on the other hand, and
representation of both sets of parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, and
in any such event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid
by the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall (x) without the prior
written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or
proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential
parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include a
statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by
or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (y) be liable for any settlement of
any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying
party or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action,
the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified
party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Interpretation_. Article, Section, Schedule, and Exhibit
references are to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All references
to instruments, documents, contracts, and agreements are references to such
instruments, documents, contracts, and agreements as the same may be amended,
supplemented, and otherwise modified from time to time, unless otherwise
specified. The word "including" shall mean "including but not limited to."
Whenever any party has an obligation under the Operative Documents, the
expense of complying with that obligation shall be an expense of such party
unless otherwise specified. Whenever any determination, consent, or approval
is to be made or given by any Purchaser, such action shall be in such
Purchasers sole discretion unless otherwise specified in this Agreement. If
any provision in the Operative Documents is held to be illegal, invalid, not
binding, or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable and the
Operative Documents shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid, not binding, or unenforceable provision had

 



       
 

 



 

never comprised a part of the Operative Documents, and the remaining
provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The Operative Documents have
been reviewed and negotiated by sophisticated parties with access to legal
counsel and shall not be construed against the drafter.

execution and delivery of this Agreement for two years, and the other
representations and warranties set forth herein shall survive for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Partnership or any Purchaser. The covenants made
in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of the transactions described
herein and remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
acceptance of any of the Purchased Units and payment therefor and repayment,
conversion, exercise or repurchase thereof. All indemnification obligations of
the Partnership and the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement and the
provisions of _Article VI_ shall remain operative and in full force and
effect unless such obligations are expressly terminated in a writing by the
parties, regardless of any purported general termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3 _No Waiver; Modifications in Writing_.

 



 

(a) _Delay_. No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power, or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power, or remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies that may be available to a party at law or in equity
or otherwise.

 



 

(b) _Specific Waiver_. Except as otherwise provided herein, no amendment,
waiver, consent, modification, or termination of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Operative Document shall be effective unless signed by
each of the parties hereto or thereto affected by such amendment, waiver,
consent, modification, or termination. Any amendment, supplement or
modification of or to any provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, and any consent to any departure by the
Partnership from the terms of any provision of this Agreement shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
made or given. Except where notice is specifically required by this Agreement,
no notice to or demand on the Partnership in any case shall entitle the
Partnership to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.

 



 

(a) _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Partnership,
the Purchasers, and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except
as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not be construed
so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Assignment of Rights_. All or any portion of the rights and obligations
of any Purchaser under this Agreement may be transferred by such Purchaser to
any Affiliate of such Purchaser without the consent of the Partnership. No
portion of the rights and obligations of any Purchaser under this Agreement
may be transferred by such Purchaser to a non-Affiliate without the written
consent of the Partnership (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
by the Partnership).

 



 

Section 7.5 _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, to the extent that any Purchaser has executed or is otherwise bound
by a confidentiality agreement in favor of the Partnership, such Purchaser
shall continue to be bound by such confidentiality agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Communications_. All notices and demands provided for hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be given by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, telecopy, air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery or
personal delivery to the following addresses:

Attention: Glen C. Warren, Jr.

 

Facsimile: (303) 357-7315

Houston, Texas 77002

 

Attention: W. Matthew Strock

 

Facsimile: (713) 615-5650

transmittal, if sent via electronic mail; upon actual receipt if sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or regular mail, if mailed; when
receipt acknowledged, if sent via facsimile; and upon actual receipt when
delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.7 _Removal of Legend_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership, at its sole cost, shall remove the legend described in
_Section 4.9_ (or instruct its transfer agent to so remove such legend) from
the certificates evidencing Purchased Units issued and sold to each Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement if (i) such Purchased Units are sold pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) such Purchased
Units are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 (if the transferor is not
an Affiliate of the Partnership), or (iii) such Purchased Units are eligible
for sale under Rule 144, without the requirement for the Partnership to be in
compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(1)
(or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable) as to such securities and without volume or
manner-of-sale restrictions. Each Purchaser agrees to provide the Partnership,
its counsel and/or the transfer agent with evidence reasonably requested by it
in order to cause the removal of the legend described in _Section 4.9_,
including, as may be appropriate, any information the Partnership deems
necessary to determine that the legend is no longer required under the
Securities Act or applicable state laws, including a certification that the
holder is not an Affiliate of the Partnership (and a covenant to inform the
Partnership if it should thereafter become an Affiliate and to consent to
exchange its certificates for certificates bearing an appropriate restrictive
legend) and regarding the length of time the Purchased Units have been held.
Any fees (with respect to the transfer agent, Partnership counsel or
otherwise) associated with the issuance of any legal opinion required by the
Partnerships transfer agent or the removal of such legend shall be borne by
the Partnership. If a legend is no longer required pursuant to the foregoing,
the Partnership will use commercially reasonable efforts to, no later than
three (3) Business Days following the delivery by a Purchaser to the
Partnership or the transfer agent (with notice to the Partnership) of a
legended certificate or instrument representing Purchased Units (endorsed or
with stock powers attached, signatures guaranteed, and otherwise in form
necessary to affect the reissuance and/or transfer) and any representation
letter or certification as may be requested by the Partnership, deliver or
cause to be delivered to such Purchaser a certificate or instrument (as the
case may be) representing such Purchased Units that is free from all
restrictive legends.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Operative Documents
and the other agreements and documents referred to herein are intended by the
parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete
and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties
hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein. There
are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties or undertakings,
other than those set forth or referred to herein or the other Operative
Documents with respect to the rights granted by the Partnership or any of its
Affiliates or any Purchaser or any of its Affiliates set forth herein or
therein. This Agreement, the other Operative Documents and the other
agreements and documents referred to herein or therein supersede all prior
agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject
matter.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Governing Law_. **This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard
to conflict of laws principles (other than Section 5-1401 of the General
Obligations Law).**

 



 

Section 7.10 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered,
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken
together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. In the event

 



      
 

 



 

that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and
binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature
is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Termination_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be
terminated at any time at or prior to the Closing by any Purchaser (with
respect to such Purchaser only), upon a breach in any material respect by the
Partnership of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall
automatically terminate at any time at or prior to the Closing

 



 

(i) if a statute, rule, order, decree or regulation shall have been enacted or
promulgated, or if any action shall have been taken by any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction that permanently restrains, permanently
precludes, permanently enjoins or otherwise permanently prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or makes the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal;

 



 

(ii) upon the termination of the Contribution Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) if the Closing shall not have occurred by September 25, 2015.

 



 

(c) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in this
_Section 7.11_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void. In the
event of such termination, there shall be no liability on the part of any
party hereto, except as set forth in _Section 5.3_ and _Article VI_ of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Recapitalization, Exchanges, Etc. Affecting the Common Units_.
The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth
herein with respect to any and all equity interests of the Partnership or any
successor or assign of the Partnership (whether by merger, consolidation, sale
of assets or otherwise) which may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or
in substitution of, the Common Units, and shall be appropriately adjusted for
combinations, unit splits, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing.

held by the Partnership or one of its subsidiaries or Affiliates; (d) when

transaction in which the transferors rights under this Agreement are not

without restriction and without the need for current public information
pursuant to any section of Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in effect)
under the Securities Act.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

Section 2.01 _Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Effectiveness Deadline_. Following the date hereof, but no later than 30
days following the Closing Date, the Partnership shall prepare and file a
registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the public resale of
Registrable Securities then outstanding from time to time as permitted by Rule
415 (or any similar provision then in effect) under the Securities Act with
respect to all of the Registrable Securities (the " _Registration Statement_
"). The Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_ shall
be on such appropriate registration form or forms of the Commission as shall
be selected by the Partnership so long as it

 



      
 

 



 

permits the continuous offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule
415 (or any similar provision then in effect) under the Securities Act at
then-prevailing market prices. The Partnership shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective on
or as soon as practicable after the filing thereof. Any Registration Statement
shall provide for the resale pursuant to any method or combination of methods
legally available to, and requested by, the Holders of any and all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement. The Partnership shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_ to be effective, supplemented and amended
to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for the resale of all
Registrable Securities by the Holders until all Registrable Securities covered
by such Registration Statement have ceased to be Registrable Securities (the "
_Effectiveness Period_ "). The Registration Statement when effective
(including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to
form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the
case of any prospectus contained in such Registration Statement or documents
incorporated therein by reference, in the light of the circumstances under
which a statement is made). As soon as practicable following the date that the
Registration Statement becomes effective, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days of such date, the Partnership shall provide the Holders with
written notice of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

 



 

(b) _Failure to Go Effective_. If the Registration Statement required by
_Section 2.01(a)_ is not declared effective within 90 days after the Closing
Date, then each Purchaser shall be entitled to a payment (with respect to the
Purchased Units of each such Purchaser), as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty, of 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period, that
shall accrue daily, for the first 30 days following the 90th day, increasing
by an additional 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period,
that shall accrue daily, for each subsequent 30 days, up to a maximum of 1.00%
of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period (the " _Liquidated
Damages_ "). The Liquidated Damages payable pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall be payable within ten (10) Business Days after the
end of each such 30-day period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in no event shall the aggregate of all Liquidated Damages
payable by the Partnership hereunder exceed 5.00% of the Aggregate Purchase
Price. Any Liquidated Damages shall be paid to each Purchaser in immediately
available funds; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Partnership certifies that it
is unable to pay Liquidated Damages in cash because such payment would result
in a breach of or constitute a default under a credit facility or other debt
instrument, then the Partnership shall pay such Liquidated Damages using as
much cash as is permitted without causing a breach of or default under such
credit facility or other debt instrument and shall pay the balance of any such
Liquidated Damages in kind in the form of the issuance of additional Common
Units. Upon any issuance of Common Units as Liquidated Damages, the
Partnership shall promptly (i) prepare and file an amendment to the
Registration Statement prior to its effectiveness adding such Common Units to
such Registration Statement as additional Registrable Securities and (ii)
prepare and file a supplemental listing application with the NYSE (or such
other national securities exchange on which the Common Units are then-listed
and traded) to list such additional Common Units. The determination of the
number of Common Units to be issued as Liquidated Damages shall be equal to
quotient of (i) the dollar amount of the balance of such Liquidated Damages
due to each such Purchaser divided by (ii) the volume-weighted average

 



      
 

 



 

trading price of the Common Units on the NYSE, or any other national
securities exchange on which the Common Units are then-traded, for the ten
(10) trading days ending on the first trading day immediately preceding the
date on which the Liquidated Damages payment is due, less a discount to such
average closing price of 2.00%. The payment of Liquidated Damages to a
Purchaser shall cease at the earlier of (i) the Registration Statement
becoming effective or (ii) when such Purchaser no longer holds Registrable
Securities, assuming that each Holder is not an Affiliate of the Partnership,
and any payment of Liquidated Damages shall be prorated for any period of less
than 30 days in which the payment of Liquidated Damages ceases. If the
Partnership is unable to cause a Registration Statement to go effective within
90 days after the Closing Date as a result of an acquisition, merger,
reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction, then the Partnership
may request a waiver of the Liquidated Damages, and each Purchaser may
individually grant or withhold its consent to such request in its discretion.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Purchaser s Rights_. A Purchasers rights (and any
transferees rights pursuant to _Section 2.11_ of this Agreement) under this
_Section 2.01_ shall terminate upon the termination of the Effectiveness
Period.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Piggyback Rights_.

 



 

(a) _Participation_. If the Partnership proposes to file (i) a shelf
registration statement other than the Registration Statement contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)_, (ii) a prospectus supplement to an effective shelf
registration statement, other than the Registration Statement contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)_ of this Agreement and Holders may be included without the
filing of a post-effective amendment thereto, or (iii) a registration
statement, other than a shelf registration statement, in each case, for the
sale of Common Units in an Underwritten Offering for its own account and/or
another Person, then as soon as practicable following the engagement of
counsel by the Partnership to prepare the documents to be used in connection
with an Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall give notice (including,
but not limited to, notification by electronic mail) of such proposed
Underwritten Offering to each Holder (together with its Affiliates) holding at
least $15 million of the then-outstanding Registrable Securities (based on the
Common Unit Price) and such notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to
include in such Underwritten Offering such number of Registrable Securities
(the " _Included Registrable Securities_ ") as each such Holder may request in
writing; _provided, however_ , that if the Partnership has been advised by the
Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of Registrable Securities for sale for
the benefit of the Holders will have an adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of the Common Units in the Underwritten Offering, then (A) if no
Registrable Securities can be included in the Underwritten Offering in the
opinion of the Managing Underwriter, the Partnership shall not be required to
offer such opportunity to the Holders or (B) if any Registrable Securities can
be included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the Managing
Underwriter, then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered for the
accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of _Section
2.02(b)_. Any notice required to be provided in this _Section 2.02(a)_ to
Holders shall be provided on a Business Day pursuant to _Section 3.01_ hereof
and receipt of such notice shall be confirmed by the Holder. Each such Holder
shall then have two (2) Business Days (or one (1) Business Day in connection
with any overnight or bought Underwritten Offering) after notice has been
delivered to request in writing the inclusion of Registrable Securities in the
Underwritten Offering. If no written request for inclusion from a Holder is
received within the specified time, each such Holder shall have no

 



      
 

 



 

further right to participate in such Underwritten Offering. If, at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten
Offering and prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, the
Partnership shall determine for any reason not to undertake or to delay such
Underwritten Offering, the Partnership may, at its election, give written
notice of such determination to the Selling Holders and, (x) in the case of a
determination not to undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved
of its obligation to sell any Included Registrable Securities in connection
with such terminated Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case of a
determination to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay
offering any Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay
in the Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to
withdraw such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering by giving written notice
to the Partnership of such withdrawal at or prior to the time of pricing of
such Underwritten Offering. Any Holder may deliver written notice (an " _Opt-
Out Notice_ ") to the Partnership requesting that such Holder not receive
notice from the Partnership of any proposed Underwritten Offering; _provided,
however_ , that such Holder may later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in
writing. Following receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from a Holder (unless
subsequently revoked), the Partnership shall not be required to deliver any
notice to such Holder pursuant to this _Section 2.02(a)_ and such Holder
shall no longer be entitled to participate in Underwritten Offerings by the
Partnership pursuant to this _Section 2.02(a)_. The Holders indicated on
_Schedule A_ hereto as having opted out shall each be deemed to have delivered
an Opt-Out Notice as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) _Priority_. If the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters of any proposed
Underwritten Offering advises the Partnership that the total amount of
Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders and any other Persons intend
to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such
offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing
or distribution of the Common Units offered or the market for the Common
Units, then the Common Units to be included in such Underwritten Offering
shall include the number of Registrable Securities that such Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters advises the Partnership can be sold without having
such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to the
Partnership and (ii) second, pro rata among the Selling Holders who have
requested participation in such Underwritten Offering and any other holder of
securities of the Partnership having rights of registration that are neither
expressly senior nor subordinated to the Registrable Securities (the " _Parity
Securities_ "). The pro rata allocations for each Selling Holder who has
requested participation in such Underwritten Offering shall be the product of
(a) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering multiplied by (b) the fraction derived by dividing (x)
the number of Registrable Securities owned on the Closing Date by such Selling
Holder by (y) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned on the
Closing Date by all Selling Holders plus the aggregate number of Parity
Securities owned on the Closing Date by all holders of Parity Securities that
are participating in the Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Piggyback Registration Rights_. Each Holders rights under
this _Section 2.02_ shall terminate upon such Holder (together with its
Affiliates) ceasing to hold at least $15 million of Registrable Securities
(based on the Common Unit Price). Each Holder shall notify the Partnership in
writing when such Holder holds less than $15 million of Registrable Securities
(based on the Common Unit Price).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.03 _Delay Rights_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Partnership
may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable Securities
are included in the Registration Statement or other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, suspend such Selling Holders use of any
prospectus which is a part of the Registration Statement or other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement (in which event the Selling Holder
shall discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement or such other registration statement but may settle any
previously made sales of Registrable Securities) if (i) the Partnership is
pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition, financing or
other similar transaction and the Partnership determines in good faith that
the Partnerships ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be
materially adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction
in the Registration Statement or such other registration statement or (ii) the
Partnership has experienced some other material non-public event, the
disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the
Partnership, would materially adversely affect the Partnership; _provided,
however_ , in no event shall the Selling Holders be suspended from selling
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement or such other
registration statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in
any 180-day period or 105 days in any 365-day period, in each case, exclusive
of days covered by any lock-up agreement executed by a Selling Holder in
connection with any Underwritten Offering. Upon disclosure of such information
or the termination of the condition described above, the Partnership shall
provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are
included in the Registration Statement or other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of
sales it has put into effect and shall take such other reasonable actions to
permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this
Agreement.

 



 

If (i) the Selling Holders shall be prohibited from selling their Registrable
Securities under the Registration Statement or other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement as a result of a suspension pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph in excess of the periods permitted therein or
(ii) the Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated
by this Agreement is filed and declared effective but, during the
Effectiveness Period, shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail to be
usable for its intended purpose without being succeeded within 30 Business
Days by a post-effective amendment thereto, a supplement to the prospectus or
a report filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or
l5(d) of the Exchange Act, then, until the suspension is lifted or a post-
effective amendment, supplement or report is filed with the Commission, but
not including any day on which a suspension is lifted or such amendment,
supplement or report is filed and declared effective, if applicable, the
Partnership shall pay the Selling Holders an amount equal to the Liquidated
Damages, following the earlier of (x) the date on which the suspension period
exceeded the permitted period and (y) the thirty-first (31st) Business Day
after the Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated
by this Agreement ceased to be effective or failed to be useable for its
intended purposes, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty (for purposes of
calculating Liquidated Damages, the date in (x) or (y) above shall be deemed
the "90th day," as used in the definition of Liquidated Damages). For purposes
of this paragraph, a suspension shall be deemed lifted on the date that notice
that the suspension has been terminated is delivered to the Selling Holders.
Liquidated Damages pursuant to this paragraph shall cease to accrue

 



      
 

 



 

upon the Purchased Units held of record by such Holder becoming eligible for
resale without restriction and without the need for current public information
under any section of Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in effect) under
the Securities Act, assuming that such Holder is not an Affiliate of the
Partnership, and any payment of Liquidated Damages shall be prorated for any
period of less than 30 days in which the payment of Liquidated Damages ceases.

 



 

Section 2.04 _Underwritten Offerings_.

 



 

(a) _General Procedures_. In connection with any Underwritten Offering under
this Agreement, the Partnership shall be entitled to select the Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters. In connection with an Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this Agreement in which a Selling Holder participates, each
Selling Holder and the Partnership shall be obligated to enter into an
underwriting agreement that contains such representations, covenants,
indemnities and other rights and obligations as are customary in underwriting
agreements for firm commitment offerings of securities. No Selling Holder may
participate in such Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder agrees to
sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting
agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting agreement. Each Selling Holder may, at its option, require that
any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements
on the part of, the Partnership to and for the benefit of such underwriters
also be made to and for such Selling Holders benefit and that any or all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to its obligations. No
Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to
or agreements with the Partnership or the underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder, its
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by Law. If any
Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such Selling
Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to the Partnership and the
Managing Underwriter; _provided, however_ , that such withdrawal must be made
up to and including the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering. No such
withdrawal or abandonment shall affect the Partnerships obligation to pay
Registration Expenses. The Partnerships management may but shall not be
required to participate in a roadshow or similar marketing effort in
connection with any Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(b) _No Demand Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
no Holder shall be entitled to any "demand" rights or similar rights that
would require the Partnership to effect an Underwritten Offering solely on
behalf of the Holders.

 



 

Section 2.05 _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations under this
_Article II_, the Partnership will, as expeditiously as possible:

 



 

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
the Registration Statement and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep the Registration
Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) if a prospectus or prospectus supplement will be used in connection with
the marketing of an Underwritten Offering from the Registration Statement and
the Managing Underwriter at any time shall notify the Partnership in writing
that, in the sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed
information to be used in such prospectus or prospectus supplement is of
material importance to the success of the Underwritten Offering of such
Registrable Securities, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to include such information in such prospectus or prospectus
supplement;

 



 

(c) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or amendment
thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such
documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and
its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the corrections
reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such information
prior to filing the Registration Statement or such other registration
statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such number of copies
of the Registration Statement or such other registration statement and the
prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein and any supplements
and amendments thereto as such Selling Holder may reasonably request in order
to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement or other registration
statement;

 



 

(d) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement or
any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter, shall
reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership will not be
required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction where
it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would subject
it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
so subject;

 



 

(e) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any
such other registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto,
when the same has become effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written
comments from the Commission with respect to any filing referred to in _clause
(i)_ and any written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements
to the Registration Statement or any such other registration statement or any
prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;

 



 

(f) promptly notify each Selling Holder of (i) the happening of any event as a
result of which the prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in the
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or

 



       
 

 



 

necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made); (ii) the issuance or
express threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of any proceedings
for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Partnership of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable
Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any
jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, the Partnership agrees,
subject to _Section 2.03_ of this Agreement, to as promptly as practicable
amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other
appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and to take
such other commercially reasonable action as is necessary to remove a stop
order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;

 



 

(g) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,
furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or
self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic
or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable
Securities;

 



 

(h) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish upon request, (i) an
opinion of counsel for the Partnership dated the date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement and (ii) a "comfort" letter, dated the pricing date of
such Underwritten Offering and a letter of like kind dated the date of the
closing under the underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the
independent public accountants who have certified the Partnerships financial
statements included or incorporated by reference into the applicable
registration statement, and each of the opinion and the "comfort" letter shall
be in customary form and covering substantially the same matters with respect
to such registration statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus
supplement included therein) as have been customarily covered in opinions of
issuers counsel and in accountants letters delivered to the underwriters in
Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership and such other matters
as such underwriters and Selling Holders may reasonably request;

 



 

(i) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement,
which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

 



 

(j) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and Selling Holders access to such information and Partnership
personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish a
due diligence defense under the Securities Act; _provided_ , that the
Partnership need not disclose any non-public information to any such
representative unless and until such representative has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Partnership;

 



      
 

 



 

(k) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Partnership are
then listed;

 



 

(l) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Partnership to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities;

 



 

(m) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration statement;

 



 

(n) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities; and

 



 

(o) if requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a prospectus or
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement
such information as such Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included
therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities,
including information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities
being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other
terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such
offering and (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus or prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment after being notified of the matters to
be incorporated in such prospectus or prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment.

 



 

The Partnership shall not name a Holder as an underwriter as defined in
Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act in any registration statement without
such Holders consent. If the staff of the Commission requires the Partnership
to name any Holder as an underwriter as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act, or the Partnership deems it advisable, on the advice of
counsel, to so name any Holder, and such Holder does not consent thereto, then
such Holders Registrable Securities shall not be included on the Registration
Statement (or any other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement), such Holder shall no longer be entitled to receive Liquidated
Damages under this Agreement with respect thereto, the Partnership shall have
no further obligations hereunder with respect to Registrable Securities held
by such Holder and such Holder shall be deemed to have terminated this
Agreement with respect to such Holder.

 



 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the
happening of any event of the kind described in _subsection (f)_ of this
_Section 2.05_, shall forthwith discontinue offers and sales of the
Registrable Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until
such Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus or prospectus supplement contemplated by _subsection (f_ ) of this
_Section 2.05_ or until it is advised in writing by the Partnership that the
use of the prospectus or prospectus supplement may be resumed and has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by reference in
the prospectus or prospectus supplement, and, if so directed by the
Partnership, such Selling Holder will, or will request the Managing
Underwriter(s), if any, to deliver to the Partnership (at the Partnerships
expense) all copies in their possession or control, other than

 



      
 

 



 

permanent file copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of the
prospectus or prospectus supplement covering such Registrable Securities
current at the time of receipt of such notice.

 



 

Section 2.06 _Cooperation by Holders_. The Partnership shall have no
obligation to include in the Registration Statement, or in an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_, Registrable Securities of a Holder
who has failed to timely furnish such information that the Partnership
determines, after consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in
order for the registration statement or prospectus or prospectus supplement,
as applicable, to comply with the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 2.07 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees, if requested by the
underwriters of an Underwritten Offering, to enter into a customary letter
agreement with such underwriters providing such Holder will not effect any
public sale or distribution of Registrable Securities during the 60 calendar
day period beginning on the date of a prospectus or prospectus supplement
filed with the Commission with respect to the pricing of any Underwritten
Offering, _provided_ that (i) the duration of the foregoing restrictions shall
be no longer than the duration of the shortest restriction generally imposed
by the underwriters on the Partnership or the officers, directors or any other
Affiliate of the Partnership on whom a restriction is imposed and (ii) the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 2.07_ shall not apply to any
Registrable Securities that are included in such Underwritten Offering by such
Holder. In addition, this _Section 2.07_ shall not apply to any Holder that
is not entitled to participate in such Underwritten Offering, whether because
such Holder delivered an Opt-Out Notice prior to receiving notice of the
Underwritten Offering or because such Holder holds less than $15 million of
the then-outstanding Registrable Securities.

 



 

Section 2.08 _Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _Expenses_. The Partnership will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses
as determined in good faith, including, in the case of an Underwritten
Offering, whether or not any sale is made pursuant to such Underwritten
Offering. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all Selling
Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder.
In addition, except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.09_ hereof, the
Partnership shall not be responsible for professional fees incurred by Holders
in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to the Partnerships performance under or compliance with this
Agreement to effect the registration of Registrable Securities on the
Registration Statement pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ or an Underwritten
Offering covered under this Agreement, and the disposition of such Registrable
Securities, including, without limitation, all registration, filing,
securities exchange listing and NYSE fees, all registration, filing,
qualification and other fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue
sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fees of
transfer agents and registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses, any transfer taxes and the fees and disbursements of counsel and
independent public accountants for the Partnership, including the expenses of
any special audits or "comfort" letters required by or incident to such
performance and compliance. " _Selling Expenses_ " means all underwriting
fees,

 



      
 

 



 

discounts and selling commissions or similar fees or arrangements allocable to
the sale of the Registrable Securities.

 



 

Section 2.09 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _By the Partnership_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the
Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder,
its directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person, if any, who
controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees or agents (collectively,
the " _Selling Holder Indemnified Persons_ "), against any losses, claims,
damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint or several, to which such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person may become subject under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact (in the case of any prospectus or prospectus supplement, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statement is made) contained in
the Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, preliminary prospectus supplement,
free writing prospectus or final prospectus or prospectus supplement contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of a prospectus or prospectus supplement, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse
each such Selling Holder Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such Loss or actions or proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the
Partnership will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any
such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with
information furnished by such Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing
specifically for use in the Registration Statement or such other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus,
preliminary prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus, or final
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereof. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder
Indemnified Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such
Selling Holder.

 



 

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, the General Partner,
its directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person, if any, who
controls the Partnership within the meaning of the Securities Act or of the
Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, to the same
extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to the Selling Holders,
but only with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished
in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in
the Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, preliminary prospectus supplement,
free writing prospectus or final prospectus or prospectus supplement contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof; _provided, however_ , that
the liability of each Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the
dollar amount of the proceeds (net

 



      
 

 



 

of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

 



 

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this _Section
2.09_. In any action brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify
the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party
shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to
assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to
such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this _Section 2.09_ for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected;
_provided, however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume
the defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party
or (ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall
have concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the
indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party
reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying
party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate
counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the
defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate
counsel and other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be
reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall settle any action
brought against any indemnified party with respect to which such indemnified
party is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or
obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all
liability of, the indemnified party.

 



 

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section
2.09_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on
the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in
excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by
such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one
hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has
been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to

 



      
 

 



 

correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph
were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include
any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any Loss that is the subject of
this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.09_ shall be
in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the
Partnership agrees to:

 



 

(a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep public
information regarding the Partnership available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times from and after
the date hereof;

 



 

(b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission in a
timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Partnership
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at all times from and after the
date hereof; and

 



 

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the
extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of the
Partnership that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
under the Securities Act, and (ii) unless otherwise available via EDGAR, to
such Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Partnership, and such other reports and documents so
filed as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or
regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such securities
without registration.

 



 

Solely for purposes of this _Section 2.10_, the term "Registrable Securities"
shall be read without regard to the limitation set forth in _Section
1.02(e)_.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities granted to the
Purchasers by the Partnership under this _Article II_ may be transferred or
assigned by any Purchaser to one or more transferees or assignees of
Registrable Securities; _provided, however,_ that (a) unless the transferee or
assignee is an Affiliate of, and after such transfer or assignment continues
to be an Affiliate of, such Purchaser, the amount of Registrable Securities
transferred or assigned to such transferee or assignee shall represent at
least $15 million of Registrable Securities (based on the Common Unit Price),
(b) the Partnership is given written notice prior to any said transfer or
assignment, stating the name and address of each such transferee or assignee
and identifying the securities with respect to which such registration rights
are being transferred or assigned, (c) each such

 



      
 

 



 

transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of
the obligations of such Purchaser under this Agreement and (d) the transferor
or assignor is not relieved of any obligations or liabilities hereunder
arising out of events occurring prior to such transfer.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date hereof, the Partnership shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities, enter into any
agreement with any current or future holder of any securities of the
Partnership that would allow such current or future holder to require the
Partnership to include securities in any registration statement filed by the
Partnership on a basis other than _pari passu_ with, or expressly subordinate
to the rights of, the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder.

liability company, no recourse under this Agreement or under any documents or
instruments delivered in connection herewith or therewith shall be had against
any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the
Purchasers or any former, current or future director, officer, employee,
agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate
of any of the foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable Law, it
being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever

of group or entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way
acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Purchaser shall be entitled

i. Each of the Partnership Entities has been duly formed and is validly
existing as a limited partnership or limited liability company, as applicable,
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with all limited
partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, power and
authority necessary to (A) conduct its business as described in the SEC
Reports, and (B) enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement,
the Contribution Agreement and each of the other Operative Documents to which
it is a party;

 



 

ii. Each of the Partnership Entities is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign limited liability company or limited partnership, as applicable, in
good standing in all jurisdictions listed on _Annex A_ hereto;

 



 

iii. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership and
owns a noneconomic general partner interest in the Partnership; the General
Partner Interest has been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance
with the Partnership Agreement, is fully paid (to the extent required under
the Partnership Agreement) and conforms in all material respects to the
description thereof contained in the SEC Reports; and the General Partner
Interest is owned free and clear of any Liens (1) in respect of which a
financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Delaware
naming the General Partner as debtor is on file in the office of the Delaware
Secretary of State or (2) otherwise known to us, without independent
investigation, other than (A) restrictions on transferability contained in the
Partnership Agreement and (B) Liens created by or arising under the Delaware
LP Act;

 



 

iv. As of the date hereof, immediately after the offer, issuance and sale of

by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware LP Act); and the
Incentive Distribution Rights and the Sponsor Units are owned free and clear

Agreement, (B) Liens created by or arising under the Delaware LP Act and (C)
pledges of equity interests in connection with Anteros revolving credit

x. Each of the Contribution Agreement, this Agreement and the Registration
Rights Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Partnership Entities party thereto; the Contribution Agreement and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchasers, the
Registration Rights Agreement constitute valid and legally binding agreements
of the Partnership Entities party thereto, enforceable against the Partnership
Entities party thereto in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions;

 



 

xi. The Contribution Agreement is in a form legally sufficient as between the
parties thereto to transfer or convey to the Partnership all of Anteros
right, title and interest in and to the Water Assets and the limited liability
company interests in Antero Water, subject to the conditions, reservations,
encumbrances and limitations described therein;

 



 

xii. The offering, issuance and sale of the Purchased Units, the execution,
delivery and performance of the Contribution Agreement, this Agreement and the
other Operative Documents by the Partnership Entities party thereto, the
consummation of the Contribution or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Operative Documents and the application of the
proceeds from the sale of the Purchased Units, in each case, do not and will
not result in a breach or

      
 

 



 

violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets of
the Partnership Entities pursuant to (1) the Organizational Documents of any
of the Partnership Entities, (2) the Delaware LLC Act, the Delaware LP Act or
applicable U.S. federal law or any order, judgment, decree or injunction known
to us of any U.S. federal or Delaware court or governmental agency or body
having jurisdiction over the Partnership Entities or any of their properties
in a proceeding in which any of them or their respective properties is a party
or (3) any agreement or instrument filed as an exhibit to the SEC Reports;
except in the case of clauses (2) and (3) for such breaches, violations,
defaults and Liens as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect, it being understood with respect to clause (2) above,
we express no opinion as to the application of any state securities or Blue
Sky laws or federal or state antifraud laws, rules or regulations;

 



 

xiii. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any
person (including any governmental agency or body or any court) is required to
be obtained or made by any of the Partnership Entities in connection with the
Contribution or the execution, delivery and performance by the Partnership
Entities of the Contribution Agreement, this Agreement and the other Operative
Documents, except (A) for the approvals required by the Commission in
connection with the Partnerships obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement, (B) such as have been obtained or made, or (C) such as may be
required under federal or state securities laws or by the FINRA rules, in each
case except where the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization
or order of, or filing with, would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of the Partnership Parties to consummate the Contribution
or the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, this Agreement
or the other Operative Documents;

 



 

xiv. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each of
the Purchasers and the Partnership contained in this Agreement, the sale and
issuance of the Purchased Units by the Partnership to the Purchasers solely in
the manner contemplated by this Agreement are exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act; provided, that, we will express no opinion
as to any subsequent sale or resale; and

 



 

xv. None of the Partnership Entities is now and, after giving effect to the
